<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 14"><h1>
Output Feedback (aka Pixels-to-Torques)</h1>

  <p>In this chapter we will finally start considering systems of the form:
  \begin{gather*} \bx[n+1] = {\bf f}(\bx[n], \bu[n], \bw[n]) \\ \by[n] =
  {\bf g}(\bx[n], \bu[n], \bv[n]),\end{gather*} where most of these symbols
  have been <a href="robust.html">described before</a>, but we have now added
  $\by[n]$ as the output of the system, and $\bv[n]$ which is representing
  "measurement noise" and is typically the output of a random process.  In
  other words, we'll finally start addressing the fact that we have to make
  decisions based on sensor measurements -- most of our discussions until now
  have tacitly assumed that we have access to the true state of the system for
  use in our feedback controllers (and that's already been a hard problem).
  </p>

  <p>In some cases, we will see that the assumption of "full-state feedback" is
  not so bad -- we do have good tools for state estimation from raw sensor data.
  But even our best state estimation algorithms do add some dynamics to the
  system in order to filter out noisy measurements; if the time constants of
  these filters is near the time constant of our dynamics, then it becomes
  important that we include the dynamics of the estimator in our analysis of the
  closed-loop system.</p>

  <p>In other cases, it's entirely too optimistic to design a controller
  assuming that we will have an estimate of the full state of the system.  Some
  state variables might be completely unobservable, others might require
  specific "information-gathering" actions on the part of the controller.</p>

  <p>For me, the problem of robot manipulation is one important application
  domain where more flexible approaches to output feedback become critically
  important. Imagine you are trying to design a controller for a robot that
  needs to button the buttons on your shirt.  Our current tools would require
  us to first estimate the state of the shirt (how many degrees of freedom does
  my shirt have?); but certainly the full state of my shirt should not be
  required to button a single button.  Or if you want to program a robot to
  make a salad -- what's the state of the salad?  Do I really need to know the
  positions and velocities of every piece of lettuce in order to be successful?
  These questions are (finally) getting a lot of attention in the research
  community these days, under the umbrella of "learning state representations".
  But what does it mean to be a good state representation?  There are a number
  of simple lessons from output feedback in control that can shed light on this
  fundamental question.
  </p>

  <section><h1>Background</h1>
    <subsection><h1>The classical perspective</h1>

      <p>To some extent, this idea of calling out "output feedback" as an
      advanced topic is a relatively new problem.  Before state-space and
      optimization-based approaches to control ushered in "modern control", we
      had "classical control".  Classical control focused predominantly (though
      not exclusively) on linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, and made very
      heavy use of frequency-domain analysis (e.g. via the Fourier
      Transform/Laplace Transform).  There are many excellent books on the
      subject; <elib>Hespanha09+Astrom10</elib> are nice examples of modern
      treatments that start with state-space representations but also treat the
      frequency-domain perspective. "Pole placement" and "loop shaping" are some
      of the tools of this trade.</p>

      <p>What's important for us to acknowledge here is that in classical
      control, basically everything was built around the idea of output
      feedback.  The fundamental concept is the transfer function of a system,
      which is a input-to-output map (in frequency domain) that can completely
      characterize an LTI system.  Core concepts like pole placement and loop
      shaping were fundamentally addressing the challenge of output feedback
      that we are discussing here.  Sometimes I feel that, despite all of the
      things we've gained with modern, optimization-based control, I worry that
      we've lost something in terms of considering rich characterizations of
      closed-loop performance (rise time, dwell time, overshoot, ...) and
      perhaps even in practical robustness of our systems to unmodeled
      errors.</p>

      <todo>Add a few examples here that capture it.</todo>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>From pixels to torques</h1>

      <p>Just like some of our oldest approaches to control were fundamentally
      solving an output feedback problem, some of our newest approaches to
      control are doing it, too. Deep learning has revolutionized computer
      vision, and "deep imitation learning" and "deep reinforcement learning"
      have been a recent source of many impressive demonstrations of control
      systems that can operate directly from pixels (e.g. consuming the output
      of a deep perception system), without explicitly representing nor
      estimating the full state of the system.  Unfortunately, the success or
      failure of these methods are not yet well understood, and they often
      require a great deal of artisanal tuning and an embarrassing (sometimes
      prohibitive) amount of computation.</p>

      <p>The synthesis of ideas between machine learning (both theoretical and
      applied) and control theory is one of the most exciting and productive
      frontiers for research today.  I am highly optimistic that we will be
      able to uncover the underlying principles and help transition this
      budding field into a technology. I hope that summarizing some of the key
      lessons from control here can help.</p>
    </subsection>

  </section>

  <section><h1>Static Output Feedback</h1>
  
    <p>One of the extremely important almost unstated lessons from dynamic
    programming with additive costs and the Bellman equation is that the
    optimal policy can <i>always</i> be represented as a function $\bu^*
    = \pi^*(\bx).$ So far in these notes, we've assumed that the controller has
    direct access to the true state, $\bx$. In this chapter, we are finally
    removing that assumption. Now the controller only has direct access to the
    potentially noisy observations $\by$.</p>

    <p>So the natural first question to ask might be, what happens if we write
    our policies now as a function, $\bu = \pi(\by)?$  This is known as
    "static" output feedback, in contrast to "dynamic" output feedback where
    the controller is not a static function, but is itself another input-output
    dynamical system. Unfortunately, in the general case it is <i>not</i> the
    case that optimal policies can be perfectly represented with static output
    feedback.  But one can still try to solve an optimal control problem where
    we restrict our search to static policies; our goal will be to find the
    best controller in this class to minimize the cost.</p>

    <subsection><h1>A hardness result</h1>
    
      <p>We've already seen <a
      href="policy_search.html#static_output_feedback">an example</a> of a very
      simple linear control problem where the set of stabilizing feedback gains
      formed a disconnected set -- which is suggestive that it could be a
      difficult problem for optimization.  For some other problems in control,
      we've been able to find a convex reparametrization.</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, <elib>Blondel97</elib> showed that the question of
      whether a stabilizing static output feedback $\bu = -\bK \by$ even exists
      for a given system of the form $$\dot\bx = \bA\bx + \bB\bu,\quad \by =
      \bC \bx,$$ is NP-hard. Many of the strongest results from $H_2$ and
      $H_\infty$ design, for instance, are limited to dynamic controllers that
      can effectively reconstruct the entire state.</p>
      
      <p>Just because this problem is NP-hard doesn't mean we can't find good
      controllers in practice. Some of the recent results from reinforcement
      learning have reminded us of this. We should not expect an efficient
      globally optimal algorithm that works for every problem instance; but we
      should absolutely keep working on the problem. Perhaps the class of
      problems that our robots will actually encounter in the real world is a
      easier than this general case (the standard examples of bad cases in
      linear systems, e.g. with interleaved poles and zeros, do feel a bit
      contrived and unlikely to occur in practice).</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Via policy search</h1>

      <p>Searching for the best controller within a parametric class of
      policies is generally referred to as <a href="policy_search.html">policy
      search</a>.  If we do policy search on a class of static output feedback
      policies, how well does it perform?  Of course, the answer depends on the
      particular governing equations (for instance, $\by = \bx$ is a perfectly
      reasonable output, and in this case the policy can be optimal).</p>

      https://youtu.be/JhjROrZxBhM?t=1099 and "what goes wrong in output

so we have three broad approaches to searching for linear dynamical controllers (for linear dynamical plants): 1) gradient descent in the original parameters.  you have asymptotic convergence, but not a guaranteed rate.
2) convex reparameterizations (e.g. from scherer).  in here there is a rank condition is trivially satisfied, and therefore disappears, when dim(xc) >= dim(x)
3) Youla/SLS, which in the time-domain is a finite-time synthesis but can be used to recover the LDC to arbitrary precision (e.g. via Ho-Kalman).
is that a reasonable summary? 

jack  11:36 AM
I think this is reasonable :slightly_smiling_face: I would probably add the Riccati solutions of the famous DGKF paper https://authors.library.caltech.edu/3087/1/DOYieeetac89.pdf (if you wanted “completeness”)
gradient descent in original parameters; no suboptimal stationary points for minimal controllers
finite dimensional convex reparametrizations from Scherer, as you wrote
DGKF solution: solve two Riccati equations
Disturbance feedback: Youla/Q/SLS, etc. Synthesis problem is convex, but the decision variable(s) are infinite dimensional, but stable, transfer functions. Various approximations can be used (most common these days, for academic examples and learning theorists, is FIR).
11:37
I would be a bit cautious about recovering the LDC with Ho-Kalman. Nik Matni and James Anderson had a paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8262844 about recovering state-space controllers from FIRs, in the SLS setting. According to James, I don’t think they meant it as a serious paper (i.e. something that you would ever actually implement), just an investigation.
I suppose I should re-read that paper, but there was no dimensionality reduction going on, when recovering a state-space representation of the FIR

  <p>Here is a simple extension of the <a href="lqr.html#sls">LQR with
  least-squares derivation</a>... (it's a work in progress!)</p>
  
  <p>Given the state space equations: \begin{gather*} \bx[n+1] = \bA\bx[n] +
  \bB\bu[n] + \bw[n],\end{gather*} Consider parametrizing an output feedback
  policy of the form $$\bu[n] = \bK_0[n] \bx_0 +
  \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\bK_i[n]\bw[n-i],$$ then the closed-loop state is convex in
  the control parameters, $\bK$: \begin{align*}\bx[n] =& \left( {\bf A}^n +
  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{\bf A}^{n-i-1}{\bf B}{\bf K}_0[i] \right) \bx_0 +
  \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{\bf A}^{n-i-1}{\bf B}{\bf K}_{j}[i]
  \bw[i-j],\end{align*} and therefore objectives that are convex in $\bx$ and
  $\bu$ (like LQR) are also convex in $\bK$.  Moreover, we can calculate
  $\bw[n]$ by the time that it is needed given our observations of $\bx[n+1],
  \bx[n],$ and knowledge of $\bu[n].$</p>

  <p>We can extend this to output disturbance-based feedback: \begin{gather*}
  \bx[n+1] = \bA\bx[n] + \bB\bu[n] + \bw[n],\\ \by[n] = \bC\bx[n] + \bv[n],
  \end{gather*} by parametrizing an output feedback policy of the form
  $$\bu[n] = \bK_0[n] \by[0] + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\bK_i[n]{\bf e}[n-i],$$ where ${\bf e}[n] = ...$ <elib>Sadraddini20</elib>.</p>
