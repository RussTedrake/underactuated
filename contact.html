<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 16"><h1>Planning and
Control through Contact</h1>

  <p>So far we have developed a fairly strong toolbox for planning and control
  with "smooth" systems -- systems where the equations of motion are described
  by a function $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx,\bu)$ which is smooth everywhere.  But our
  <a href="simple_legs.html">discussion of the simple
  models of legged robots</a> illustrated that the dynamics of making and
  breaking contact with the world are more complex -- these are often modeled
  as hybrid dynamics with impact discontinuities at the collision event and
  constrained dynamics during contact (with either soft or hard
  constraints).</p>

  <p>My goal for this chapter is to extend our computational tools into this
  richer class of models.  Many of our core tools still work: trajectory
  optimization, Lyapunov analysis (e.g. with sums-of-squares), and LQR all have
  natural equivalents.</p>

  <p>Let's start with a warm-up exercise: trajectory optimization for the rimless wheel.  We already have basically everything that we need for this, and it will form a nice basis for generalizing our approach throughout the chapter.</p>

  <example><h1>Trajectory optmization for the rimless wheel</h1>

    <figure>
      <img width="40%" src="figures/rimlessWheel.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The rimless wheel. The orientation of the stance leg,
      $\theta$, is measured clockwise from the vertical axis. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The <a href="simple_legs.html#rimless_wheel">rimless wheel</a> was our
    simplest example of a passive-dynamic walker; it has no control inputs but
    exhibits a passively stable rolling fixed point.  We've also <a
    href="limit_cycles.html">already seen</a> that trajectory optimization can
    be used as a tool for finding limit cycles of a smooth passive system, e.g.
    by formulating a direct collocation problem: \begin{align*}
    \find_{\bx[\cdot],h} \quad \subjto \quad & \text{collocation
    constraints}(\bx[n], \bx[n+1], h), \quad \forall n \in [0, N-1] \\ & \bx[0]
    = \bx[N], \\ & h_{min} \le h \le h_{max},\end{align*} where $h$ was the
    timestep between the trajectory break points.</p>

    <p>It turns out that applying this to the rimless wheel is quite straight
    forward.  We still want to find a periodic trajectory, but now have to take
    into account the collision event.  We can do this by modifying the
    periodicity condition.  Let's force the initial state to be just after the
    collision, and the final state to be just before the collision, and make
    sure they are related to each other via the collision equation:
    \begin{align*} \find_{\bx[\cdot],h} \quad \subjto \quad & \text{collocation
    constraints}(\bx[n], \bx[n+1], h), \quad \forall n \in [0, N-1] \\ &
    \theta[0] = \gamma - \alpha, \\ & \theta[N] = \gamma + \alpha, \\ &
    \dot\theta[0] = \dot\theta[N] \cos(2\alpha)\\ & h_{min} \le h \le h_{max}.
    \end{align*}  Although it is likely not needed for this simple example
    (since the dynamics are sufficiently limited), for completeness one should
    also add constraints to ensure that none of the intermediate points are in
    contact, $$\gamma - \alpha \le \theta[n] < \gamma + \alpha, \quad \forall n
    \in [1,N-1].$$</p>

    <p>The result is a simple and clean numerical algorithm for finding the
    rolling limit cycle solution of the rimless wheel.  Please take it for a
    spin:</p>

    <jupyter>examples/contact.ipynb</jupyter>

  </example>

  <p>The specific case of the rimless wheel is quite clean.  But before we apply
  it to the compass gait, the kneed compass gait, the spring-loaded inverted
  pendulum, etc, then we should stop and figure out a more general form.</p>

  <section><h1>(Autonomous) Hybrid Systems</h1>
  
    <p>Recall how we modeled the dynamics of the simple legged robots. First, we
    derived the equations of motion (independently) for each possible contact
    configuration -- for example, in the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP)
    model we had one set of equations governing the $(x,y)$ position of the mass
    during the flight phase, and a completely separate set of equations written
    in polar coordinates, $(r,\theta)$, describing the stance phase.  Then we
    did a little additional work to describe the transitions between these
    models -- e.g., in SLIP we transitioned from flight to stance when the foot
    first touches the ground.  When simulating this model, it means that we have
    a discrete "event" which occurs at the moment of foot collision, and an
    immediate discontinuous change to the state of the robot (in this case we
    even change out the state variables).</p>
  
    <p>The language of <i>hybrid systems</i> gives us a rich language for
    describing systems of this form, and a suite of tools for analyzing and
    controlling them.  The term "hybrid systems" is a bit overloaded, here we
    use "hybrid" to mean both discrete- and continuous-time, and the particular
    systems we consider here are sometimes called <i>autonomous</i>
    hybrid systems because the internal dynamics can cause the discrete changes
    without any exogeneous input&dagger;<sidenote>&dagger;This is in contrast
    to, for instance, the model of a power-train where a change in gears comes
    as an external input.</sidenote>.  In the hybrid systems formulation, we describe a system by a set of <i>modes</i> each described by (ideally
    smooth) continuous dynamics, a set of <i>guards</i> which here are
    continuous functions whos zero-level set describes the conditions which
    trigger an event, and a set of <i>resets</i> which describe the discrete
    update to the state that is triggered by the guard.  Each guard is
    associated with a particular mode, and we can have multiple guards per mode.
    Every guard has at most one reset.  You will occasionally here guards
    referred to as "witness functions", since they play that role in simulation,
    and resets are sometimes referred to as "transition functions".</p>

    <p>The imagery that I like to keep in my head for hybrid systems is
    illustrated below for a simple example of a robot's heel striking the
    ground.  A solution trajectory of the hybrid system has a continuous
    trajectory inside each mode, punctuated by discrete updates when the
    trajectory hits the zero-level set of the guard (here the distance between
    the heel and the ground becomes zero), with the reset describing the
    discrete change in the state variables.</p>
  
    <figure> <img width="90%" src="figures/hybrid.svg"/>
    <figcaption>Modeling contact as a hybrid system.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>For this robot foot, we can decompose the dynamics into distinct modes: (1) foot in the air, (2) only heel on the ground, (3) heel and toe on the ground, (4) only toe on the ground (push-off). More generally, we will write the dynamics of mode $i$ as ${\bf f}_i$, the guard which signals the transition mode $i$ to mode $j$ as ${\bf \phi}_{i,j}$ (where $\phi_{i,j}(\bx_i) > 0$ inside mode $i$), and the reset map from $i$ to $j$ as ${\bf \Delta}_{i,j}$, as illustrated in the following figure:</p>

    <figure> <img width="100%" src="figures/hybrid_guard_reset.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The language of hybrid systems: modes, guards, and reset maps.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  

    <subsection><h1>Hybrid trajectory optimization</h1>
    
      <p>Using the more general language of modes, guards, and resets, we can begin to formulate the "hybrid trajectory optimization" problem.  In hybrid trajectory optimization, there is a major distinction between trajectory optimization where <i>the mode sequence is known apriori</i> and the optimization is just attempting to solve for the continuous-time trajectories, vs one in which we must also discover the mode sequence.</p>

      <p>For the case when the mode sequence is fixed, then hybrid trajectory
      optimization is as simple as stitching together multiple individual
      mathematical programs into a single mathematical program, with the
      boundary conditions constrained to enforce the guard/reset constraints.
      For a simple hybrid system with a given a mode sequence and using the
      shorthand $\bx_k$, etc, for the state in mode in the $k$th segment of the
      sequence, we can write: \begin{align*} \find_{\bx_k[\cdot],h_k} \quad
      \subjto \quad & \bx_0[0] = \bx_0, \\ \forall k \quad &
      \phi_{k,k+1}(\bx_k[N_k]) = 0, \\ & \bx_{k+1}[0] = {\bf
      \Delta}_{i,j}(\bx_k[N_k]), \\ & \phi_{k,k'}(\bx_k[n_k]) > 0, \quad \forall
      n_k \in [0, N_k], \forall k' \\ & h_{min} \le h_k \le h_{max}, \\ &
      \text{collocation constraints}_k(\bx_k[n_k], \bx_k[n_k+1], h_k), \quad
      \forall n_k \in [0, N_k-1]. \end{align*} It is then natural to add control
      inputs (as additional decision variables), and to add an objective and any
      more constraints.
      </p>

      <example><h1>A basketball trick shot.</h1>
      
        <p>As a simple example of this hybrid trajectory optimization, I thought it would be fun to see if we can formulate the search for initial conditions that optimizes a basketball "trick shot".  A quick search turned up <a href="https://youtu.be/Mayx9OrXWIM">this video</a> for inspiration.</p>

        <p>Let's start simpler -- with just a "bounce pass".  We can capture the
        dynamics of a bouncing ball (in the plane, ignoring spin) with some very
        simple dynamics: $$\bq = \begin{bmatrix}x \\ z\end{bmatrix}, \qquad
        \ddot{\bq} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -g \end{bmatrix}.$$  During any time
        interval without contact of duration $h$, we can actually integrate
        these dynamics perfectly: $$\bx(t+h) = \begin{bmatrix} x(t) +
        h\dot{x}(t) \\ z(t) + h \dot{z}(t) - \frac{1}{2}gh^2 \\ \dot{x}(t) \\
        \dot{z}(t) - hg \end{bmatrix}.$$  With the bounce pass, we just consider
        collisions with the ground, so we have a guard, ${\bf \phi}(\bx) = z,$
        which triggers when $z=0$, and a reset map which assumes an elastic
        collision with <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution">coefficient
        of restitution</a> $e$: $$\bx^+ = {\bf \Delta(\bx^-)} = \begin{bmatrix}
        x^- & z^- & \dot{x}^- & - e \dot{z}^- \end{bmatrix}^T.$$</p>

        <p>We'll formulate the problem as this:  given an initial ball position
        $(x = 0, z = 1)$, a final ball position 4m away $(x=4, z=1)$, find the
        initial velocity to achieve that goal in 5 seconds.  Clearly, this
        implies that $\dot{x}(0) = 4/5.$  The interesting question is -- what
        should we do with $\dot{z}(0)$?  There are multiple solutions -- which
        involve bouncing a different number of times.  We can find them all with
        a simple hybrid trajectory optimization, using the observation that
        there are two possible solutions for each number of bounces -- one that
        starts with a positive $\dot{z}(0)$ and one with a negative
        $\dot{z}(0)$.</p>

          <figcaption>Trajectory optimization to find solutions for a "bounce
          pass".  I've plotted all solutions that were found for 2, 3, or 4 bounces... but I think it's best to stick to a single bounce if you're using this on the court.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Now let's try our trick shot.  I'll move our goal to $x_f = -1m, z_f
        = 3m,$ and introduce a vertical wall at $x=0$, and move our initial
        conditions back to $x_0=-.25m.$  The collision dynamics, which now must
        take into account the spin of the ball, are <a
        href="multibody.html#spinning_ball_bouncing">in the appendix</a>.  The
        first bounce is against the wall, the second is against the floor.  I'll
        also constrain the final velocity to be down (have to approach the hoop
        from above).  Try it out.</p>

          the bottom of the net!  The crowd is going wild!</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>In this example, we could integrate the dynamics in each segment
        analytically.  That is the exception, not the rule.  But you can take
        the same steps with a little more code to use, e.g. direct transcription
        or collocation with multiple break points in each segment.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Deriving hybrid models: minimal vs floating-base
    coordinates</h1>

      <p>There is some work to do in order to derive the equations of motion in
      this form.  Do you remember how we did it for the <a
      href="simple_legs.html">rimless wheel and compass gait</a> examples?  In
      both cases we assumed that exactly one foot was attached to the ground and
      that it would not slip, this allowed us to write the Lagrangian as if
      there was a pin joint attaching the foot to the ground to obtain the
      equations of motion.  For the SLIP model, we derived the flight phase and
      stance phase using separate Lagrangian equations each with different state
      representations.  I would describe this as the <i>minimal coordinates</i>
      modeling approach -- it is elegant and has some important computational
      advantages that we will come to appreciate in the algorithms below. But
      it's a lot of work!  For instance, if we also wanted to consider friction
      in the foot contact of the rimless wheel, we would have to derive yet
      another set of equations to describe the sliding mode (adding, for
      instance, a prismatic joint that moved the foot along the ramp), plus the
      guards which compute the contact force for a given state and the distance
      from the boundary of the friction cone, and on and on.</p>
    
      <!-- But, actually, it could get more complicated still: in each of the contact modes the foot could be in the static friction regime or could be sliding.  And what if there is rough terrain, so we could make contact at more points.  And what if we -->

      <p>Fortunately, there is an alternative modeling approach for deriving the
      modes, guards, and resets for contact that is more general (though
      admittedly also more complex).  We can instead model the robot in the
      <i>floating-base coordinates</i> -- we add a fictitious six
      degree-of-freedom "floating-base" joint connecting some part of the robot
      to the world (in planar models, we use just three degrees-of-freedom, e.g.
      $(x,z,\theta)$).  We can derive the equations of motion for the
      floating-base robot once, without considering contact, then add the
      additional constraints that come from being in contact as contact forces
      which get applied to the bodies. The resulting manipulator equations take
      the form \begin{equation}\bM({\bq})\ddot{\bq} + \bC(\bq,\dot{\bq})\dot\bq
      = \btau_g(\bq) + \bB\bu + \sum_i \bJ_i^T(\bq) \blambda_i,\end{equation}
      where $\blambda_i$ are the constraint forces and $\bJ_i$ are the
      constraint Jacobians.  Conveniently, if the guard function in our contact
      equations is the signed distance from contact, $\phi_i(\bq)$, then this
      Jacobian is simply $\bJ_i(\bq) = \pd{\phi_i}{\bq}$.  I've written the
      basic derivations for the common cases (position constraints, velocity
      constraints, impact equations, etc) in the
      <a href="multibody.html">appendix</a>. What is important to understand
      here is that this is an alternative formulation for the equations
      governing the modes, guards, and resets, but that is it no longer a
      minimal coordinate system -- the equations of motion are written in $2N$
      state variables but the system might actually be constrained to evolve
      only along a lower dimensional manifold (if we write the rimless wheel
      equations with three configuration variables for the floating base, it
      still only rotates around the toe when it is in stance and is inside the
      friction cone). This will have implications for our algorithms.</p>

    <todo>Grandia 2019 - Feedback MPC for Torque-controlled Legged Robots looks
    at a relaxation of the friction cone via a barrier certificate for iLQR.
    "In particular, the friction cone is implemented through a perturbed
    second-order cone constraint. This for- mulation adds a convex penalty to
    the cost function and avoids numerical ill-conditioning at the origin of the
    cone."  Could go in the playbook, if not here.</todo>
