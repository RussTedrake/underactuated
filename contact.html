<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 16"><h1>Planning and
Control through Contact</h1>

  <p>So far we have developed a fairly strong toolbox for planning and control
  with "smooth" systems -- systems where the equations of motion are described
  by a function $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx,\bu)$ which is smooth everywhere.  But our
  <a href="simple_legs.html">discussion of the simple
  models of legged robots</a> illustrated that the dynamics of making and
  breaking contact with the world are more complex -- these are often modeled
  as hybrid dynamics with impact discontinuities at the collision event and
  constrained dynamics during contact (with either soft or hard
  constraints).</p>

  <p>My goal for this chapter is to extend our computational tools into this
  richer class of models.  Many of our core tools still work: trajectory
  optimization, Lyapunov analysis (e.g. with sums-of-squares), and LQR all have
  natural equivalents. </p>

  <section><h1>Modeling and Simulating through Contact</h1>

    <p>Recall how we modeled the dynamics of the simple legged robots. First,
    we derived the equations of motion (independently) for each possible
    contact configuration -- for example, in the spring-loaded inverted
    pendulum (SLIP) model we had one set of equations governing the $(x,y)$
    position of the mass during the flight phase, and a completely separate set
    of equations written in polar coordinates, $(r,\theta)$, describing the
    stance phase.  Then we did a little additional work to describe the
    transitions between these models -- e.g., in SLIP we transitioned from
    flight to stance when the foot first touches the ground.  When simulating
    this model, it means that we have a discrete "event" which occurs at the
    moment of foot collision, and an immediate discontinuous change to the
    state of the robot (in this case we even change out the state variables).
    </p>

    <p>The language of <i>hybrid systems</i> gives us a rich language for
    describing systems like this, and a suite of tools for simulating them.
    <sidenote>The term "hybrid systems" means a lot of things to a lot of
    people... here we use "hybrid" to mean both discrete and continuous, and
    the particular systems we consider here are sometimes called
    <i>autonomous</i> hybrid systems because the internal dynamics can cause
    the discrete changes without any exogeneous input; in contrast to, for
    instance, the model of a power-train where a change in gears comes as an
    external input.</sidenote>  More generally, we say that a hybrid systems is
    described by a set of <i>modes</i> each described by (ideally smooth)
    continuous dynamics, a set of <i>guards</i> which here are continuous
    functions who's zero-level set describes the conditions which trigger an
    event, and a set of <i>resets</i> which describe the discrete update to the
    state that is triggered by the guard.  Each guard is associated with a
    particular mode, and we can have multiple guards per mode. Every guard has
    at most one reset.  You will occasionally here guards referred to as
    "witness functions", since they play that role in simulation, and resets
    are sometimes referred to as "transition functions".</p>

    <p>The imagery that I like to keep in my head for hybrid systems is
    illustrated below for a simple example of a robot's heel striking the
    ground.  A solution trajectory of the hybrid system has a continuous
    trajectory inside each mode, punctionated by discrete updates when the
    trajectory hits the zero-level set of the guard (here the distance between
    the heel and the ground becomes zero), with the reset describing the
    discrete change in the state variables.</p>

    <p>There is some work to do in order to derive the equations of motion in
    this form.  Do you remember how we did it for the <a
    href="simple_legs.html">rimless wheel and compass
    gait</a> examples?  In both cases we assumed that exactly one foot was
    attached to the ground and that it would not slip, this allowed us to write
    the Lagrangian as if there was a pin joint attaching the foot to the ground
    to obtain the equations of motion.  For the SLIP model, we derived the
    flight phase and stance phase using separate Lagrangian equations each with
    different state representations.  I would describe this as the <i>minimal
    coordinates</i> modeling approach -- it is elegant and has some important
    computational advantages that we will come to appreciate in the algorithms
    below. But it's a lot of work!  For instance, if we also wanted to consider
    friction in the foot contact of the rimless wheel, we would have to derive
    yet another set of equations to describe the sliding mode (adding, for
    instance, a prismatic joint that moved the foot along the ramp), plus the
    guards which compute the contact force for a given state and the distance
    from the boundary of the friction cone, and on and on.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there is an alternative modeling approach for deriving the
    modes, guards, and resets for contact that is more general (though
    admittedly also more complex).  We can instead model the robot in the
    <i>floating-base coordinates</i> -- we add a fictitious six
    degree-of-freedom "floating-base" joint connecting some part of the robot to
    the world (in planar models, we use just three degrees-of-freedom, e.g.
    $(x,z,\theta)$).  We can derive the equations of motion for the
    floating-base robot once, without considering contact, then add the
    additional constraints that come from being in contact as contact forces
    which get applied to the bodies. The resulting manipulator equations take
    the form \begin{equation}\bM({\bq})\ddot{\bq} + \bC(\bq,\dot{\bq})\dot\bq =
    \btau_g(\bq) + \bB\bu + \sum_i \bJ_i^T(\bq) \blambda_i,\end{equation} where
    $\blambda_i$ are the constraint forces and $\bJ_i$ are the constraint
    Jacobians.  Conveniently, if the guard function in our contact equations is
    the signed distance from contact, $\phi_i(\bq)$, then this Jacobian is
    simply $\bJ_i(\bq) = \pd{\phi_i}{\bq}$.  I've written the basic derivations
    for the common cases (position constraints, velocity constraints, impact
    equations, etc) in the
    <a href="multibody.html">appendix</a>. What is
    important to understand here is that this is an alternative formulation for
    the equations governing the modes, guards, and resets, but that is it no
    longer a minimal coordinate system -- the equations of motion are written
    in $2N$ state variables but the system might actually be constrained to
    evolve only along a lower dimensional manifold (if we write the rimless
    wheel equations with three configuration variables for the floating base,
    it still only rotates around the toe when it is in stance and is inside the
    friction cone). This will have implications for our algorithms.</p>

    <p>Finally, there are many recipes for simulating these systems.  At one
    extreme, we have integrators that do explicit event detection -- we register
    the guards of our system as "witness functions" for the event and the
    integrator ensures that it obtains a high-accuracy integration step at the
    event.  For the simulations that you see in computer graphics with a massive
    number of objects interacting with each other, coarser approximations are
    often used, such as the time-stepping approximations which solve a small
    optimization problem at every integration step to compute time-averaged
    contact forces to summarize the impact events without explicit event
    detection.  I'll leave the details to the <a
    href="multibody.html">appendix</a>, but will use both approaches in this
    chapter for control and analysis. </p>
