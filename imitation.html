<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 100"><h1>Imitation Learning</h1>

  <p>Two dominant approaches to imitation learning are <i>behavioral cloning</i> and <i>inverse reinforcement learning</i>...
  </p>

  <section><h1>Diffusion Policy</h1>
  
    <p>One particularly successful form of behavior cloning for visuomotor
    policies with continuous action spaces is the <a
    href="https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/">Diffusion Policy</a>
    <elib>Chi23</elib>. The dexterous manipulation team at TRI had been working
    on behavior cloning for some time, but the Diffusion Policy (which started
    as a summer internship project!) architecture has allowed us to very
    reliably train <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-CGSQAO5-Q">incredibly dexterous
    tasks</a> and really start to scale up our ambitions for manipulation.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Denoising Diffusion models</h1>
    
      <p>"Denoising Diffusion" models are an approach to generative AI, made
      famous by their ability to generate high-resolution photorealistic
      images. Inspired by the "manifold hypothesis" (e.g. the idea that
      realistic images live on a low-dimensional manifold in pixel space), the
      intuition behind denoising diffusion is that we train a model by adding
      noise to samples drawn from the data distribution, then learn to predict
      the noise from the noisy images, in order to "denoise" random images back
      on to the manifold. While image generation made these models famous, they
      have proven to be highly capable in generating samples from a wide
      variety of high-dimension continuous distributions, even distributions
      that are conditioned on high-dimensional inputs.</p>
      
      <p>Let's consider samples $\bu \in \Re^m$ drawn from a training dataset
      $\mathcal{D}.$ Diffusion models are trained to estimate a noise vector
      ${\bf \epsilon} \in \Re^m$ to minimize the loss function $$\ell(\theta) =
      \mathbb{E}_{\bu, {\bf \epsilon}, \sigma} || {\bf f}_\theta(\bu + \sigma
      {\bf \epsilon}, \sigma ) - {\bf \epsilon} ||^2,$$ where $\theta$ is the
      parameter vector, and $f_\theta$ is typically some high-capacity neural
      network. In practice, training is done by randomly sampling $\bu$ from
      $\mathcal{D}$, ${\bf \epsilon}$ from $\mathcal{N}({\bf 0}_m, {\bf I}_{m
      \times m})$, and $\sigma$ from a uniform distribution over a positive set
      of numbers denoted as $\{\sigma_k\}_{k=0}^K,$ where we have $\sigma_k >
      \sigma_{k-1}.$</p>

      <p>To sample a new output from the model, the denoising diffusion
      implicit models (DDIM) sampler <elib>Song20</elib> takes multiple steps:
      $$\bu_{k-1} = \bu_k + (\sigma_{k-1} - \sigma_k)f_\theta(\bu_k,
      \sigma_k).$$ This specific parameterization of the update (and my
      preferred notation more generally) comes from
      <elib>Permenter23</elib>.</p>
      
      <p>Diffusion models have a slightly convoluted history. The term
      "diffusion" came from a paper <elib>Sohl-Dickstein15</elib>
      which used an analogy from thermodynamics to use a prescribed diffusion
      process to slowly transform data into random noise, and then learned to
      reverse this procedure by training an inverse diffusion. Well before
      that, a series of work starting with <elib>Hyvarinen05</elib> studied the
      problem of learning the score function (the gradient of the log
      probability of a distribution) of a data distribution, and
      <elib>Vincent11</elib> made a connection to denoising autoencoders. 
      <elib>Song19</elib> put all of this together beautifully and combined it
      with deep learning to propose denoising diffusion as a generative
      modeling techinque. They learned a single network that was conditioned on
      the noise level. This was followed quickly by <elib>Ho20</elib>
      which introduced denoise diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) using an
      even simpler update and showed results competitive with other leading
      generative modeling techniques leading to <elib>Song20</elib> giving us
      the DDIM update above. <elib>Permenter23</elib> gives a deterministic
      interpretation as learning the distance function from the data manifold,
      and sampling as performing approximate gradient descent on this
      function.</p>
        
      <todo>Examples! Something like Figure 1 from Sohl-Dickstein15 would be
      good.</todo>

      <p>It is straight-forward to condition the generative model on an
      exogeneous input, by simply adding an additional signal, $\by$, to the
      denoiser: $f_\theta(\bu, \sigma, \by).$ </p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Diffusion Policy</h1>

      <p>Behavior cloning is perhaps the simplest form of imitation learning --
      it simply attempts learn a policy using supervised learning to match
      expert demonstrations. While it is tempting to learn deterministic
      output-feedback policies (maps from history of observations to actions),
      one quickly finds that human demonstrations are typically not unique.
      Perhaps this is not surprising, as we know that optimal feedback policies
      in general are not unique! To address this non-uniqueness /
      multi-modality in the human demonstrations, it's well understood that
      behavior cloning benefits from learning a conditional
      <i>distribution</i> over actions.</p>
      
      <p>Diffusion Policy is the natural application of (conditional) denoising
      diffusion models to learning these policies. It was inspired, in
      particular, but the modeling choices in Diffuser<elib>Janner22</elib>. In
      particular, rather than generating a single action, the denoiser in
      diffusion policy outputs a sequence of actions with horizon $H_u$; like
      <elib>Zhao23</elib> we found experimentally that this leads to more
      stable roll-outs. <elib>Block23b</elib> provides some possible
      theoretical justification for this choice. We condition the input on a
      history of observations of length $H_y.$</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Diffusion Policy for LQG</h1>
    
      <p>Let me be clear, it almost certainly does <i>not</i> make sense to use
      a diffusion policy to implement LQG control. But because we understand
      LQG so well at this point, it can be helpful to understand what the
      Diffusion Policy looks like in this extremely simplified case.</p>

      <p>Consider the case where we have the standard linear-Gaussian dynamical
      system: \begin{gather*} \bx[n+1] = \bA\bx[n] + \bB\bu[n] + \bw[n], \\
      \by[n] = \bC\bx[n] + \bD\bu[n] + \bv[n], \\ \bw[n] \sim \mathcal{N}({\bf
      0}, {\bf \Sigma}_w), \quad \bv[n] \sim \mathcal{N}({\bf 0}, {\bf
      \Sigma}_v). \end{gather*} Imagine that we create a dataset by rolling out
      trajectory demonstrations using the optimal LQG policy. The question is:
      what (exactly) does the diffusion policy learn?</p>
    
      <p>Let's start with the $\mathcal{H}_2$ problem (e.g. <a
      href="policy_search.html#lqr">LQR with Gaussian noise</a>), where the
      observation and prediction horizons are limited to a single step, $H_y =
      H_u = 1$, and the denoiser is conditioned directly on state observations.
      We will generate roll-outs using the optimal policy, $\bu = - \bK^*\bx$,
      given a Gaussian distribution of intial conditions and Gaussian process
      noise. In this case, the training loss function reduces to $$\ell(\theta)
      = \mathbb{E}_{\bx, {\bf \epsilon}, \sigma} || {\bf f}_\theta(-\bK\bx +
      \sigma {\bf \epsilon}, \sigma, \bx) - {\bf \epsilon} ||^2,$$ where the
      expectation in $\bx$ is over the <a
      href="policy_search.html#lqr">stationary distribution of the optimal
      policy</a>. In this case, we don't need a neural network; take $f_\theta$
      to be a simple function. In particular the optimal denoiser is given by
      $${\bf f}_\theta(\bu, \sigma, \bx) = \frac{1}{\sigma}\left[\bu +
      \bK\bx\right].$$ At evaluation time, the sampling iterations, $$\bu_{k-1}
      = \bu_k + \frac{\sigma_{k-1} - \sigma_k}{\sigma_k}\left[\bu_k +
      \bK\bx\right],$$ will converge on $\bu_0 = -\bK\bx.$ (Clearly $\bu_k =
      -\bK\bx$ is a fixed point of the iteration, and the $\frac{\sigma_{k-1} -
      \sigma_k}{\sigma_k}$ term is like the step-size of gradient descent.)</p>

      <p>Returning to LQG, the diffusion policy architecture will be learning a
      denoiser conditioned on a finite history of actions and observations,
      $f_\theta(\bu[n], \sigma, \by[n-1], \bu[n-1], ..., \by[n-H_y],
      \bu[n-H_y]).$</p>
