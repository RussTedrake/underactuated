<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 8"><h1>Lyapunov
  Analysis</h1>

  <p>Optimal control provides a powerful framework for formulating control
  problems using the language of optimization.  But solving optimal control
  problems for nonlinear systems is hard!  In many cases, we don't really care
  about finding the <em>optimal</em> controller, but would be satisfied with any
  controller that is guaranteed to accomplish the specified task.  In many
  cases, we still formulate these problems using computational tools from
  optimization, and in this chapter we'll learn about tools that can provide
  guaranteed control solutions for systems that are beyond the complexity for
  which we can find the optimal feedback.</p>

  <p>There are many excellent books on Lyapunov analysis; for instance
  <elib>Slotine90</elib> is an excellent and very readable reference and
  <elib>Khalil01</elib> can provide a rigorous treatment.  In this chapter I
  will summarize (without proof) some of the key theorems from Lyapunov
  analysis, but then will also introduce a number of numerical algorithms...
  many of which are new enough that they have not yet appeared in any mainstream
  textbooks.</p>

  <section><h1>Lyapunov Functions</h1>

    <p>Let's start with our favorite simple example. </p>

    <example><h1>Stability of the Damped Pendulum</h1>

      <center><img width="25%" src="figures/simple_pend.svg"/></center>

      <p>Recall that the equations of motion of the damped simple pendulum are
      given by \[ ml^2 \ddot{\theta} + mgl\sin\theta = -b\dot{\theta}, \] which
      I've written with the damping on the right-hand side to remind us that it
      is an external torque that we've modeled.</p>

      <p>These equations represent a simple second-order differential equation;
      in chapter 2 we discussed at some length what was known about the
      solutions to this differential equation--in practice we do not have a
      closed-form solution for $\theta(t)$ as a function of the initial
      conditions.  Since we couldn't provide a solution analytically, in chapter
      2 we resorted to a graphical analysis, and confirmed the intuition that
      there are fixed points in the system (at $\theta = k\pi$ for every integer
      $k$) and that the fixed points at $\theta = 2\pi k$ are asymptotically
      stable with a large basin of attraction.  The graphical analysis gave us
      this intuition, but can we actually prove this stability property?  In a
      way that might also work for much more complicated systems?</p>

      <p>One route forward was from looking at the total system energy (kinetic
      + potential), which we can write down: \[ E(\theta,\dot{\theta}) =
      \frac{1}{2} ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 - mgl \cos\theta. \] Recall that the
      contours of this energy function are the orbits of the undamped
      pendulum.</p>

      <center><img width="50%" src="figures/pend_undamped_phase.svg"/></center>

      <p>A natural route to proving the stability of the downward fixed points
      is by arguing that energy (almost always) decreases for the damped
      pendulum ($b>0$) and so the system will eventually come to rest at
      the minimum energy, $E = -mgl$, which happens at $\theta=2\pi k$.  Let's
      make that argument slightly more precise. </p>

      <p>Evaluating the time derivative of the energy reveals \[ \frac{d}{dt} E
      = \pd{E}{\theta}\dot\theta + \pd{E}{\dot\theta}\ddot\theta = \dot\theta(ml^2\ddot\theta + mgl\sin\theta) = - b\dot\theta^2 \le 0. \] 
      So we know that energy will never increase, that energy is bounded, and that it obtains it's minima at the downward (stable) fixed points.  Moreover, we now know that energy is strictly decreasing whenever $\dot\theta \neq 0$. We're getting close.</p>

      <p>In order to show that the system converges asymptotically to some
      fixed point, we need one more observation. For non-fixed-point states
      with $\dot\theta = 0$, we have $\dot{E} = 0$, but only for an instant. A
      moment later, we'll have some non-zero velocity once again, and again
      start dissipating energy. All together, these arguments are sufficient to demonstrate that $\bx \rightarrow$ a fixed point as $t \rightarrow \infty$. We'll make this argument more general and more
      precise below.</p>
      
    </example>

    <p>This is an important example.  It demonstrated that we could use a
    relatively simple function -- the total system energy -- to describe
    something about the long-term dynamics of the pendulum even though the
    actual trajectories of the system are (analytically) very complex.  It also
    demonstrated one of the subtleties of using an energy-like function that is
    non-increasing (instead of strictly decreasing) to prove asymptotic
    stability.</p>

    <p>Lyapunov functions generalize this notion of an energy function to more
    general systems, which might not be stable in the sense of some mechanical
    energy.  If I can find any positive function, call it $V(\bx)$, that gets
    smaller over time as the system evolves, then I can potentially use $V$ to
    make a statement about the long-term behavior of the system.  $V$ is called
    a <em>Lyapunov function</em>. </p>

    <p>Recall that we defined three separate notions for stability of a
    fixed-point of a nonlinear system: stability i.s.L., asymptotic stability,
    and exponential stability.  We can use Lyapunov functions to demonstrate
    each of these, in turn.</p>

    <theorem><h1>Lyapunov's Direct Method (for local stability)</h1>

      <p>Given a system $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx)$, with $f$ continuous, and for some
      region ${\cal D}$ around the origin (specifically an open subset of
      $\mathbf{R}^n$ containing the origin), if I can produce a scalar,
      continuously-differentiable function $V(\bx)$, such that \begin{gather*}
      V(\bx) > 0, \forall \bx \in {\cal D} \setminus \{0\} \quad V(0) = 0,
      \text{ and} \\ \dot{V}(\bx) = \pd{V}{\bx} f(\bx) \le 0, \forall \bx \in
      {\cal D} \setminus \{0\} \quad \dot{V}(0) = 0, \end{gather*} then the
      origin $(\bx = 0)$ is stable in the sense of Lyapunov (i.s.L.).   [Note: the notation $A \setminus B$ represents the set $A$ with the elements of $B$ removed.]</p>

      <p>If, additionally, we have $$\dot{V}(\bx) = \pd{V}{\bx} f(\bx) < 0,
      \forall \bx \in {\cal D} \setminus \{0\},$$ then the origin is (locally)
      asymptotically stable.  And if we have $$\dot{V}(\bx) = \pd{V}{\bx} f(\bx)
      \le -\alpha V(x), \forall \bx \in {\cal D} \setminus \{0\},$$ for some $\alpha>0,$
      then the origin is (locally) exponentially stable. </p>

    </theorem>

    <p>Note that for the sequel we will use the notation $V \succ 0$ to denote a
    <em>positive-definite function</em>, meaning that $V(0)=0$ and $V(\bx)>0,$
    for all $\bx \ne 0$.  We can use "positive definite in ${\cal D}$" if this
    applies $\forall x \in {\cal D}$.  Similarly, we'll use $V \succeq 0$ for
    positive semi-definite, $V \prec 0$ for negative-definite functions,
    etc.</p>

    <p>The intuition here is exactly the same as for the energy argument we made
    in the pendulum example:  since $\dot{V}(x)$ is always zero or negative, the
    value of $V(x)$ will only get smaller (or stay the same) as time progresses.
    Inside the subset ${\cal D}$, for every $\epsilon$-ball, I can choose a
    $\delta$ such that $|x(0)|^2 < \delta \Rightarrow |x(t)|^2 < \epsilon,
    \forall t$ by choosing $\delta$ sufficiently small so that the sublevel set
    of $V(x)$ for the largest value that $V(x)$ takes in the $\delta$ ball is
    completely contained in the $\epsilon$ ball. Since the value of $V$ can only
    get smaller (or stay constant) in time, this gives stability i.s.L.. If
    $\dot{V}$ is strictly negative away from the origin, then it must eventually
    get to the origin (asymptotic stability). The exponential condition is
    implied by the fact that $\forall t>0, V(\bx(t)) \le V(\bx(0)) e^{-\alpha
    t}.$</p>

    <p> Notice that the system analyzed above, $\dot{\bx}=f(\bx)$, did not have
    any control inputs. Lyapunov analysis is used to study either the passive
    dynamics of a system or the dynamics of a closed-loop system (e.g. the
    plant and controller connected in a feedback loop).  We will see
    generalizations of the Lyapunov function ideas to input-output systems
    later in the text. </p>

    <subsection><h1>Global Stability</h1>

      <p>The notion of a fixed point being stable i.s.L. is inherently a local
      notion of stability (defined with $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ balls around
      the origin), but the notions of asymptotic and exponential stability can
      be applied globally.  The Lyapunov theorems work for this case, too, with
      only minor modification.</p>

      <theorem><h1>Lyapunov analysis for global stability</h1>

        <p>Given a system $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx)$, with $f$ continuous, if I can
        produce a scalar, continuously-differentiable function $V(\bx)$, such
        that \begin{gather*} V(\bx) \succ 0, \\ \dot{V}(\bx) = \pd{V}{\bx}
        f(\bx) \prec 0, \text{ and} \\ V(\bx) \rightarrow \infty \text{ whenever
        } ||\bx||\rightarrow \infty,\end{gather*} then the origin $(\bx = 0)$ is
        globally asymptotically stable (G.A.S.).</p>

        <p>If additionally we have that $$\dot{V}(\bx) \preceq -\alpha V(\bx),$$
        for some $\alpha>0$, then the origin is globally exponentially
        stable.</p>

      </theorem>

      <p>The new condition, on the behavior as $||\bx|| \rightarrow \infty$ is
      known as "<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radially_unbounded_function">radially
      unbounded</a>", and is required to make sure that trajectories cannot
      diverge to infinity even as $V$ decreases; it is only required for global
      stability analysis. <!-- note: the first exercise below has an example -->
      This radially unbounded condition is sufficient but is not necessary; other
      conditions can potentially be invoked to guarantee that the system avoids this
      pathology. More essential is that the resulting trajectory $\bx(t)$ is bounded for
      all $t$.</p>

    </subsection> <!-- global stability -->

    <subsection id="lasalle"><h1>LaSalle's Invariance Principle</h1>

      <p>Perhaps you noticed the disconnect between the statement above and the
      argument that we made for the stability of the pendulum.  In the pendulum
      example, using the mechanical energy resulted in a Lyapunov function time
      derivative that was only negative semi-definite, but we eventually argued
      that the fixed points were asymptotically stable.  That took a little
      extra work, involving an argument about the fact that the fixed points
      were the only place that the system could stay with $\dot{E}=0$; every
      other state with $\dot{E}=0$ was only transient. We can formalize this
      idea for the more general Lyapunov function statements--it is known as
      LaSalle's Theorem.</p>

      <theorem><h1>LaSalle's Theorem</h1>

        <p>Given a system $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx)$ with $f$ continuous. If we can
        produce a scalar function $V(\bx)$ with continuous derivatives for
        which we have $$V(\bx) \succ 0,\quad \dot{V}(\bx) \preceq 0,$$ and
        $V(\bx)\rightarrow \infty$ as $||\bx||\rightarrow \infty$, then $\bx$
        will converge to the largest <i>invariant set</i> where $\dot{V}(\bx) =
        0$.</p>

      </theorem>

      <p>To be clear, an <em>invariant set</em>, ${\cal G}$, of the dynamical
      system is a set for which $\bx(0)\in{\cal G} \Rightarrow \forall t>0,
      \bx(t) \in {\cal G}$.  In other words, once you enter the set you never
      leave.  The "largest invariant set" with $\dot{V}(\bx) = 0$ need not be
      connected; in fact for the pendulum example each fixed point is an
      invariant set with $\dot{V} = 0$, so the largest invariant set is the
      <em>union</em> of all the fixed points of the system.  There are also variants of
      LaSalle's Theorem which work over a region. For example, the total energy of the
      pendulum does not actually satisfy the radially-unbounded condition (the energy is
      finite as $\theta \rightarrow \infty$), but observing that $\bx(t)$ is bounded for
      all initial conditions is sufficient to invoke a variant of LaSalle's theorem
      <elib part="&sect;4.2">Khalil01</elib>.</p>

      <p>Finding a Lyapunov function which $\dot{V} \prec 0$ is more difficult
      than finding one that has $\dot{V} \preceq 0$.  LaSalle's theorem gives us
      the ability to make a statement about <i>asymptotic</i> stability even in
      this case.  In the pendulum example, every state with $\dot\theta=0$ had
      $\dot{E}=0$, but only the fixed points are in the largest invariant
      set.</p>

      <example id="cartpole_swingup"><h1>Swing-up for the Cart-Pole System</h1>

        <p>Recall the <a href="acrobot.html#cartpole_swingup">example of using partial-feedback linearization to generate a swing-up controller for the cart-pole system</a>.  We first examined the dynamics of the pole (pendulum) only, by writing it's energy: $$E(\bx) = \frac{1}{2}\dot\theta^2 - \cos\theta,$$ desired energy, $E^d = 1$, and the difference $\tilde{E}(\bx) = E(\bx) - E^d.$  We were able to show that our proposed controller produced $$\dot{\tilde{E}} = -k \dot\theta^2 \cos^2\theta \tilde{E},$$ where $k$ is a positive gain that we get to choose.  And we said that was good!</p>

        <p>Now we have the tools to understand that really we have a Lyapunov function $$V(\bx) = \frac{1}{2}\tilde{E}^2(\bx),$$ and what we have shown is that $\dot{V} \le 0$.  By LaSalle, we can only argue that the closed-loop system will converge to the largest invariant set, which here is the entire homoclinic orbit: $\tilde{E}(\bx) = 0$.  We have to switch to the LQR controller in order to stabilize the upright.</p>

      </figure>

        <p>As you can see from the plots, $\dot{V}(\bx)$ ends up being a quite non-trivial function!  We'll develop the computational tools for verifying the Lyapunov/LaSalle conditions for systems of this complexity in the upcoming sections.</p>

    <subsection id="HJB"><h1>Relationship to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
    equations</h1>

      <p> At this point, you might be wondering if there is any relationship
      between Lyapunov functions and the cost-to-go functions that we discussed
      in the context of dynamic programming.  After all, the cost-to-go
      functions also captured a great deal about the long-term dynamics of the
      system in a scalar function.  We can see the connection if we re-examine
      the HJB equation \[ 0 = \min_\bu \left[ \ell(\bx,\bu) +
      \pd{J^*}{\bx}f(\bx,\bu). \right] \]Let's imagine that we can solve for the
      optimizing $\bu^*(\bx)$, then  we are left with $ 0 = \ell(\bx,\bu^*) +
      \pd{J^*}{\bx}f(\bx,\bu^*) $ or simply \[ \dot{J}^*(\bx)  = -\ell(\bx,\bu^*)
      \qquad \text{vs} \qquad \dot{V}(\bx) \preceq 0. \]  In other words, in
      optimal control we must find a cost-to-go function which matches this
      gradient for every $\bx$; that's very difficult and involves solving a
      potentially high-dimensional partial differential equation.  By contrast,
      Lyapunov analysis is asking for much less - any function which is going
      downhill (at any rate) for all states.  This can be much easier, for
      theoretical work, but also for our numerical algorithms.  Also note that
      if we do manage to find the optimal cost-to-go, $J^*(\bx)$, then it can
      also serve as a Lyapunov function so long as $\ell(\bx,\bu^*(\bx)) \succeq
      0$.</p>

    <todo>Include instability results, as in Briat15 Theorem 2.2.5</todo>

    <subsection><h1>Lyapunov functions for estimating regions of
      attraction</h1>
    
        <p>There is another very important connection between Lyapunov
        functions and the concept of an invariant set: <em>any sublevel set of
        a Lyapunov function is also an invariant set</em>.  This gives us the
        ability to use sublevel sets of a Lyapunov function as approximations
        of the region of attraction for nonlinear systems. For a locally
        attractive fixed point, $\bx^*$, the <i>region of attraction</i> to
        $\bx^*$ is the largest set ${\cal D} \subseteq {\cal X}$ for which
        $\bx(0) \in {\cal D} \Rightarrow \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} \bx(t) =
        \bx^*.$ Regions of attraction are always open, connected, and invariant
        sets (with boundaries ).</p>
    
        <theorem><h1>Lyapunov invariant set and region of attraction
        theorem</h1>
    
          <p>Given a system $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx)$ with $f$ continuous, if we can
          find a scalar function $V(\bx) \succ 0$ and a bounded sublevel set
          $${\cal G}: \{ \bx | V(\bx) \le \rho \}$$ on which $$\forall \bx \in
          {\cal G}, \dot{V}(\bx) \preceq 0,$$ then ${\cal G}$ is an invariant set.
          By LaSalle, $\bx$ will converge to the largest invariant subset of ${\cal
          G}$ on which $\dot{V}=0$.<p>
    
          <p>If $\dot{V}(\bx) \prec 0$ in ${\cal G}$, then the origin is
          locally asymptotically stable and furthermore the set ${\cal G}$ is
          inside the region of attraction of this fixed point.  Alternatively,
          if $\dot{V}(\bx) \preceq 0$ in ${\cal G}$ and $\bx = 0$ is the only
          invariant subset of ${\cal G}$ where $\dot{V}=0$, then the origin is
          asymptotically stable and the set ${\cal G}$ is inside the region of
          attraction of this fixed point.
          </p>
    
        </theorem>
    
        <example><h1>Region of attraction for a one-dimensional system</h1>
    
          <p> Consider the first-order, one-dimensional system $\dot{x} = -x +
          x^3.$ We can quickly understand this system using our tools for
          graphical analysis.</p> <figure> <img width="80%"
          src="figures/cubicPolynomialExample.svg"/> </figure> <p>In the
          vicinity of the origin, $\dot{x}$ looks like $-x$, and as we move
          away it looks increasingly like $x^3$.  There is a stable fixed point
          at the origin and unstable fixed points at $\pm 1$.  In fact, we can
          deduce visually that the region of attraction to the stable fixed
          point at the origin is $\bx \in (-1,1)$.  Let's see if we can
          demonstrate this with a Lyapunov argument.</p>
    
          <p>First, let us linearize the dynamics about the origin and use the
          Lyapunov equation for linear systems to find a candidate $V(\bx)$.
          Since the linearization is $\dot{x} = -x$, if we take ${\bf Q}=1$,
          then we find ${\bf P}=\frac{1}{2}$ is the positive definite solution
          to the algebraic Lyapunov equation (\ref{eq:algebraic_lyapunov}).
          Proceeding with $$V(\bx) = \frac{1}{2} x^2,$$ we have $$\dot{V} = x
          (-x + x^3) = -x^2 + x^4.$$ This function is zero at the origin,
          negative for $|x| < 1$, and positive for $|x| > 1$.  Therefore we can
          conclude that the sublevel set $V < \frac{1}{2}$ is invariant and the
          set $x \in (-1,1)$ is inside the region of attraction of the
          nonlinear system.  In fact, this estimate is tight.</p>

    <subsection id="common-lyapunov"><h1>Robustness analysis using "common Lyapunov functions"</h1>
    
        <p>While we will defer most discussions on robustness analysis until <a
        href="robust.html">later in the notes</a>, the idea of a <em>common
        Lyapunov function</em>, which we introduced briefly for linear systems in
        the <a href="#common-lyapunov-linear">example above</a>, can be readily
        extended to nonlinear systems and region of attraction analysis.  Imagine
        that you have a model of a dynamical system but that you are uncertain
        about some of the parameters.  For example, you have a model of a
        quadrotor, and are fairly confident about the mass and lengths (both of
        which are easy to measure), but are not confident about the moment of
        inertia.  One approach to robustness analysis is to define a bounded
        uncertainty, which could take the form of $$\dot{\bx} = f_\alpha(\bx),
        \quad \alpha_{min} \le \alpha \le \alpha_{max},$$ with $\alpha$ a vector
        of uncertain parameters in your model.  Richer specifications of the
        uncertainty bounds are also possible, but this will serve for our
        examples.</p>
  
        <p>In standard Lyapunov analysis, we are searching for a function that
        goes downhill for all $\bx$ to make statements about the long-term
        dynamics of the system.  In common Lyapunov analysis, we can make many
        similar statements about the long-term dynamics of an uncertain system if
        we can find a single Lyapunov function that goes downhill <em>for all
        possible values of $\alpha$</em>.  If we can find such a function, then we
        can use it to make statements with all of the variations we've discussed
        (local, regional, or global; in the sense of Lyapunov, asymptotic, or
        exponential).</p>
  
        <example><h1>A one-dimensional system with gain uncertainty</h1>
  
          <p>Let's consider the same one-dimensional example used above, but add
          an uncertain parameter into the dynamics.  In particular, consider the
          system: $$\dot{x} = -x + \alpha x^3, \quad \frac{3}{4} < \alpha <
          \frac{3}{2}.$$ Plotting the graph of the one-dimensional dynamics for a
          few values of $\alpha$, we can see that the fixed point at the origin is
          still stable, but the <em>robust region of attraction</em> to this fixed
          point (shaded in blue below) is smaller than the region of attraction
          for the system with $\alpha=1$.</p>
  
          <figure> <img width="80%"
          src="figures/cubicPolynomialExample_gain_uncertainty.svg"/>
          </figure>
  
          <p>Taking the same Lyapunov candidate as above, $V = \frac{1}{2} x^2$,
          we have $$\dot{V} = -x^2 + \alpha x^4.$$  This function is zero at the
          origin, and negative for all $\alpha$ whenever $x^2 > \alpha x^4$, or
          $$|x| < \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_{max}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}.$$ Therefore,
          we can conclude that $|x| < \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}$ is inside the robust
          region of attraction of the uncertain system.</p>
  
        </example>
  
        <p>Not all forms of uncertainty are as simple to deal with as the gain
        uncertainty in that example.  For many forms of uncertainty, we might not
        even know the location of the fixed points of the uncertain system.  In
        this case, we can often still use common Lyapunov functions to give some
        guarantees about the system, such as guarantees of <em>robust set
        invariance</em>.  For instance, if you have uncertain parameters on a
        quadrotor model, you might be ok with the quadrotor stabilizing to a pitch
        of $0.01$ radians, but you would like to guarantee that it definitely does
        not flip over and crash into the ground.</p>
  
        <example><h1>A one-dimensional system with additive uncertainty</h1>
  
          <p>Now consider the system: $$\dot{x} = -x + x^3 + \alpha, \quad
          -\frac{1}{4} < \alpha < \frac{1}{4}.$$  Plotting the graph of the
          one-dimensional dynamics for a few values of $\alpha$, this time we can
          see that the fixed point is not necessarily at the origin;  the location
          of the fixed point moves depending on the value of $\alpha$.  But we
          should be able to guarantee that the uncertain system will stay near the
          origin if it starts near the origin, using an invariant set
          argument.</p>
  
          <figure>
            <img width="80%" src="figures/cubicPolynomialExample_additive_uncertainty.svg"/>
          </figure>
  
          <p>Taking the same Lyapunov candidate as above, $V = \frac{1}{2} x^2$,
          we have $$\dot{V} = -x^2 + x^4 + \alpha x.$$ This Lyapunov function
          allows us to easily verify, for instance, that $V \le \frac{1}{3}$ is a
          <em>robust invariant set</em>, because whenever $V = \frac{1}{3}$, we
          have $$\forall \alpha \in [\alpha_{min},\alpha_{max}],\quad
          \dot{V}(x,\alpha) < 0.$$  Therefore $V$ can never start at less than
          one-third and cross over to greater than one-third.  To see this, see
          that $$ V=\frac{1}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
          \quad \Rightarrow \quad \dot{V} = -\frac{2}{9} \pm \alpha
          \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} < 0, \forall \alpha \in
          \left[-\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4} \right]. $$  Note that not all sublevel
          sets of this invariant set are invariant.  For instance $V <
          \frac{1}{32}$ does not satisfy this condition, and by visual inspection
          we can see that it is in fact not robustly invariant.</p>

  <section id="optimization"><h1>Lyapunov analysis with convex optimization</h1>

    <p>One of the primary limitations in Lyapunov analysis as I have presented
    it so far is that it is potentially very difficult to come up with suitable
    Lyapunov function candidates for interesting systems, especially for
    underactuated systems. ("Underactuated" is almost synonymous with
    "interesting" in my vocabulary.)  Even if somebody were to give me a
    Lyapunov candidate for a general nonlinear system, the Lyapunov conditions
    can be difficult to check -- for instance, how would I check that $\dot{V}$
    is strictly negative for all $\bx$ except the origin if $\dot{V}$ is some
    arbitrarily complicated nonlinear function over a vector $\bx$?</p>

    <p>In this section, we'll look at some computational approaches to verifying
    the Lyapunov conditions, and even to searching for (the coefficients of) the
    Lyapunov functions themselves.</p>

    <p>If you're imagining numerical algorithms to check the Lyapunov conditions
    for complicated Lyapunov functions and complicated dynamics, the first
    thought is probably that we can evaluate $V$ and $\dot{V}$ at a large number
    of sample points and check whether $V$ is positive and $\dot{V}$ is
    negative.  <a
    href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/systems/analysis/test/lyapunov_test.cc">This
    does work</a>, and could potentially be combined with some smoothness or
    regularity assumptions to generalize beyond the sample points. <todo>Add
    python bindings for the pendulum energy lp lyapunov example.</todo> But in
    many cases we will be able to do better -- providing optimization algorithms
    that will rigorously check these conditions <em>for all $\bx$</em> without
    dense sampling; these will also give us additional leverage in formulating
    the search for Lyapunov functions.  </p>

    <subsection><h1>Linear systems</h1>

      <p>The Lyapunov conditions we've explored above take a particularly nice form for linear systems.</p>

      <theorem id="linear_lyapunov_eq"><h1>Lyapunov analysis for stable linear systems</h1>

        <p>Imagine you have a linear system, $\dot\bx = {\bf A}\bx$, and can
        find a Lyapunov function $$V(\bx) = \bx^T {\bf P} \bx, \quad {\bf P} =
        {\bf P^T} \succ 0,$$ which also satisfies $$\dot{V}(\bx) = \bx^T {\bf
        PA} \bx + \bx^T {\bf A}^T {\bf P}\bx \prec 0.$$ Then the origin is
        globally exponentially stable.</p>

      </theorem>

      <p>Note that the radially-unbounded condition is satisfied by ${\bf P}
      \succ 0$, and that the derivative condition is equivalent to the matrix
      condition $${\bf PA} +  {\bf A}^T {\bf P} \prec 0.$$</p>

      <p>For stable linear systems the existence of a quadratic Lyapunov
      function is actually a necessary (as well as sufficient) condition.
      Furthermore, if $\bA$ is stable, then a Lyapunov function can always be
      found by finding the positive-definite solution to the matrix Lyapunov
      equation \begin{equation}{\bf PA} + {\bf A}^T{\bf P} = - {\bf
      Q},\label{eq:algebraic_lyapunov} \end{equation} for any ${\bf Q}={\bf
      Q}^T\succ 0$.</p>

      <todo> add an example here. double integrator? re-analyze the LQR output?
      </todo>

      <p>This is a very powerful result - for nonlinear systems it will be
      potentially difficult to find a Lyapunov function, but for linear systems
      it is straightforward. In fact, this result is often used to propose
      candidate Lyapunov functions for nonlinear systems, e.g., by linearizing
      the equations and solving a local linear Lyapunov function which should
      be valid in the vicinity of a fixed point.</p>

      <p>Lyapunov analysis for linear systems has an extremely important
      connection to convex optimization. In particular, we could have also
      formulated the Lyapunov conditions for linear systems above using
      <em>semi-definite programming</em> (SDP). Semidefinite programming is a
      subset of convex optimization -- an extremely important class of problems
      for which we can produce efficient algorithms that are guaranteed find the
      global optima solution (up to a numerical tolerance and barring any
      numerical difficulties).</p>

      <p>If you don't know much about convex optimization or want a quick
      refresher, please take a few minutes to read the optimization
      preliminaries in the appendix.  The main requirement for this section is
      to appreciate that it is possible to formulate efficient optimization
      problems where the constraints include specifying that one or more
      matrices are positive semi-definite (PSD).  These matrices must be formed
      from a linear combination of the decision variables.  For a trivial
      example, the optimization $$\min_a a,\quad \subjto \begin{bmatrix} a & 0
      \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \succeq 0,$$ returns $a = 0$ (up to numerical
      tolerances).</p>

      <p>The value in this is immediate for linear systems.  For example, we
      can formulate the search for a Lyapunov function for the linear system
      $\dot\bx = {\bf A} \bx$ by using the parameters ${\bf p}$ to populate a
      symmetric matrix ${\bf P}$ and then write the SDP: \begin{equation}
      \find_{\bf p} \quad \subjto \quad {\bf P} \succeq 0, \quad {\bf PA} +
      {\bf A}^T {\bf P} \preceq 0.\label{eq:lyap} \end{equation}  Note that you
      would probably never use that particular formulation, since there
      specialized algorithms for solving the simple Lyapunov equation which are
      more efficient and more numerically stable. But the SDP formulation does
      provide something new -- it will give us our first example of robustness
      analysis. In particular, we can now easily formulate the search for a
      <i>"common Lyapunov function"</i> for uncertain linear systems.</p>

      <example id="common-lyapunov-linear"><h1>Common Lyapunov analysis for
      linear systems</h1>

        <p>Suppose you have a system governed by the equations $\dot\bx = {\bf
        A}\bx$, where the matrix ${\bf A}$ is unknown, but its uncertain
        elements can be bounded.  There are a number of ways to write down this
        uncertainty set; let us choose to write this by describing ${\bf A}$ as
        the convex combination of a number of known matrices, $${\bf A} =
        \sum_{i} \beta_i {\bf A}_i, \quad \sum_i \beta_i = 1, \quad \forall i,
        \beta_i > 0.$$  This is just one way to specify the uncertainty;
        geometrically it is describing a polygon of uncertain parameters (in the
        space of elements of ${\bf A}$ with each ${\bf A}_i$ as one of the
        vertices in the polygon.</p>

        <figure> <img width="50%"
        src="data/affine_combination_of_matrices.svg"/> </figure>

        <p>Now we can formulate the search for a common Lyapunov function using
        \[ \find_{\bf p} \quad  \subjto \quad {\bf P} \succeq 0,  \quad
        \forall_i, {\bf PA}_i + {\bf A}_i^T {\bf P} \preceq 0.\]  The solver
        will then return a matrix ${\bf P}$ which satisfies all of the
        constraints, or return saying "problem is infeasible".  It can easily be
        verified that if ${\bf P}$ satisfies the Lyapunov condition at all of
        the vertices, then it satisfies the condition for every ${\bf A}$ in the
        set:  \[ {\bf P}(\sum_i \beta_i {\bf A}_i) + (\sum_i \beta_i {\bf
        A}_i)^T {\bf P} = \sum_i \beta_i ({\bf P A}_i + {\bf A}_i^T {\bf P})
        \preceq 0, \] since $\forall i$, $\beta_i > 0$.  Note that, unlike the
        simple Lyapunov equation for a known linear system, this condition being
        satisfied is a sufficient but not a necessary condition -- it is
        possible that the set of uncertain matrices ${\bf A}$ is robustly
        stable, but that this stability cannot be demonstrated with a common
        quadratic Lyapunov function.</p>

        <p> You can try this example for yourself in <drake></drake>.</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('lyapunov', "common_lyap_linear"))</script>

        <p>As always, make sure that you open up the code and take a look.</p>

        <p>Note that the argument above does not actually make use of the
        $\sum_i \beta_i = 1;$ that assumption can be safely removed. So really,
        our common Lyapunov function, when found, has certified the convex cone
        with the $A_i$ matrices as the extreme rays. This is not surprising,
        since if we have any linear system/Lyapunov quadratic form pair $A, P$,
        then $P$ also confirms that $\beta A$ is stable for any $\beta >
        0.$ Multiplying a system matrix by a scalar will not change the sign of
        its eigenvalues.</p>

        <p>There are many small variants of this result that are potentially of
        interest.  For instance, a very similar set of conditions can certify
        "mean-square stability" for linear systems with multiplicative noise
        (see e.g. <elib>Boyd94</elib>, &sect; 9.1.1).</p>

      </example>

      <todo>Add example or exercise based on e.g. Briat15 (LPV) example 1.3.1, showing off how powerful this can be.  Also perhaps the parameter-dependent robust stability of his Def 2.3.5.</todo>

      <p>This example is very important because it establishes a connection
      between Lyapunov functions and (convex) optimization.  But so far we've
      only demonstrated this connection for linear systems where the PSD
      matrices provide a magical recipe for establishing the positivity of the
      (quadratic) functions for all $\bx$.  Is there any hope of extending this
      type of analysis to more general nonlinear systems?  Surprisingly, it
      turns out that there is.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Global analysis for polynomial systems</h1>

      <p><a href="optimization.html#sums_of_squares">Sums of squares (SOS)
      optimization</a> provides a natural generalization of the SDP formulation
      to nonlinear systems. In SDP, we were allowed to write constraints of the
      form, ${\bf P} \succeq 0$. In sums of squares optimization, we generalize
      this to writing constraints of the form "$p_\balpha(\bx)$ is SOS", where
      $p(\bx)$ is a polynomial with coefficients $\balpha$. Let's examine this
      in the specific context of Lyapunov functions.</p>
      
      <p>In linear systems, we searched over $V(\bx) = \bx^T {\bf P} \bx, {\bf
      P} \succeq 0.$ In the nonlinear generalization, we search over $$V(\bx) =
      {\bf m}^T(\bx) {\bf P} {\bf m}(\bx),\quad {\bf P} \succeq 0,$$ with ${\bf
      m}(\bx)$ a set of nonlinear basis functions. This is a linear (in the
      parameters ${\bf P}$) function approximator which is guaranteed to be
      strictly positive by virtue of being a sum of squares. While the
      positivity of this sums of squares is valid for any choice of ${\bf
      m}(\bx)$, the recipe is particularly powerful for polynomials, because
      for any polynomial, $p(\bx)$, we can confirm its positivity by creating a
      surrogate sums-of-squares representation, where we have strong recipes
      for automatically choosing good bases ${\bf m}(\bx)$ given a polynomial
      $p(\bx)$, and we can constrain that $p(\bx) = {\bf m}^T(\bx) {\bf P} {\bf
      m}(\bx)$ with <i>linear</i> constraints relating the coefficients of
      $p(\bx)$ with the coefficient in ${\bf P}$.</p>
      
      <p>This suggests that it may be possible to generalize the optimization
      approach using SDP to search for Lyapunov functions for linear systems to
      searching for Lyapunov functions for nonlinear systems: $\dot\bx =
      \bf{f}(\bx),$ where $\bf{f}$ is a vector-valued <i>polynomial</i> function.
      Importantly, if $V(\bx)$ is polynomial, and $\bf{f}(\bx)$ is polynomial, then
      $\dot{V}(\bx) = \pd{V}{\bx}{\bf f}(\bx)$ is also polynomial.</p>
      
      <p>If we parameterize a <em>fixed-degree</em> Lyapunov candidate as a
      polynomial with unknown coefficients, e.g., \[ V_\alpha(\bx) = \alpha_0 +
      \alpha_1 x_1 + \alpha_2 x_2 + \alpha_3 x_1x_2 + \alpha_4 x_1^2 + ..., \]
      then we can formulate the optimization: \begin{align*} \find_\alpha,
      \quad \subjto \quad& V_\alpha(\bx) \sos, \quad V_\alpha(0) = 0 \\ &
      -\dot{V}_\alpha(\bx) = -\pd{V_\alpha}{\bx} f(\bx) \sos. \end{align*}
      Because this is a convex optimization, the solver will return a solution
      if one exists, and this solution would certify stability i.s.L. of the
      origin. Note that I don't actually need to include the constraint
      $\dot{V}_\alpha({\bf 0}) = 0$; if $V_\alpha$ is a smooth function, is
      zero at zero, and is positive for all $\bx$, then this already implies
      that $\pd{V_\alpha}{\bx} = 0.$</p>

      <p>If we wish to demonstrate (global) asymptotic stability, then we can
      write the constraint $\dot{V}_\alpha(\bx) \prec 0$ as
      $$-\dot{V}_\alpha(\bx) - \epsilon \bx^T\bx \text{ is SOS,}$$ where
      $\epsilon$ is a small positive constant that need only be larger than the
      numerical tolerances of the solver. The conditions for exponential
      stability fit easily, too.</p>

      <example><h1>Verifying a Lyapunov candidate via SOS</h1>

        <p>This example is example 7.2 from <elib>Parrilo00</elib>. Consider
        the nonlinear system: \begin{align*} \dot{x}_0 =& -x_0 - 2x_1^2 \\
        \dot{x}_1 =& -x_1 - x_0 x_1 - 2x_1^3,\end{align*} and the <i>fixed
        </i> Lyapunov function $V(x) = x_0^2 + 2x_1^2$, test if $\dot{V}(x)$ is
        negative definite.</p>

        <p>The numerical solution can be written in a few lines of code, and
        is a convex optimization.</p>

      </example>

      <example><h1>Searching for a Lyapunov function via SOS</h1>

        <p>Verifying a candidate Lyapunov function is all well and good, but
        the real excitement starts when we use optimization to <i>find</i> the
        Lyapunov function.  In the following code, we parameterize $V(x)$ as
        the polynomial containing all monomials up to degree 2, with the
        coefficients as decision variables: $$V(x) = c_0 + c_1x_0 + c_2x_1 +
        c_3x_0^2 + c_4 x_0x_1 + c_5 x_1^2.$$  We will set the scaling
        (arbitrarily) to avoid numerical issues by setting $V(0)=0$, $V([1,0])
        = 1$.  Then we write: \begin{align*} \find_{\bc} \ \ \subjto \ \ &
        V\text{ is sos, } \\ & -\dot{V} \text{ is sos.}\end{align*}</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('lyapunov', "global_polynomial"))</script>

        <p>Up to numerical convergence tolerance, it discovers the same
        coefficients that we chose above (zeroing out the unnecessary
        terms).</p>

      </example>

      <example><h1>Cart-pole swingup (again)</h1>

        <p>In the <a href="#cartpole_swingup">cart-pole swingup example</a>, we
        took $$V(\bx) = \frac{1}{2} \tilde{E}^2(\bx) = \frac{1}{2}
        (\frac{1}{2}\dot\theta^2 - \cos\theta - 1)^2.$$ This is clearly a sum
        of squares.  Furthermore, we showed that $$\dot{V}(\bx) = -
        \dot\theta^2 \cos^2\theta \tilde{E}^2(\bx),$$ which is also a sum of
        squares.  So the proposal of using sums-of-squares optimization is not
        so different, actually, than the recipes that nonlinear control
        theorists have been using (on pen and paper) for years.</p>
        
        <p>The SOS approach, as presented so far, could take only the nonlinear
        basis, ${\bf m}(\bx)$ for the candidate Lyapunov function, the degree
        of that Lyapunov function, and the closed-loop nonlinear dynamics; it
        would recover the parameters of a Lyapunov function and a certificate
        demonstrating the $V(\bx)$ and $-\dot{V}(\bx)$ are SOS. In this case, I
        would need a basis vector that includes many more monomials: $[1,
        \dot\theta, \cos\theta, ..., \dot\theta^3, ... ]^T.$</p>

        <p>You might have noticed that I did something sneaky in here. The
        dynamics of the cart-pole are <i>not</i> simply polynomial in $\bx$;
        there are trigonometric terms in there. Setting up the equality
        constraints in an optimization requires more complicated term matching
        when trigonometric functions are involved, but the recipe still works.
        We will discuss this in more detail below.
        </p>

      </example>

      <p>It is important to remember that there are a handful of gaps which
      make the existence of this solution a sufficient condition (to guarantee
      that $V(\bx)$ is a Lyapunov function for $\bf{f}(\bx)$) instead of a necessary
      one.  First, there is no guarantee that a stable polynomial system can be
      verified using a polynomial Lyapunov function (of any degree), and in fact
      there are known counter-examples
      <elib>Ahmadi11a</elib>; here we are only searching over a fixed-degree
      polynomial.  Second, even if a polynomial Lyapunov function does exist,
      there is a gap between the SOS polynomials and the positive
      polynomials<elib part="&sect;3.1">Blekherman13</elib>.</p>

      <p>Despite these caveats, I have found this formulation to be surprisingly
      effective in practice.  Intuitively, I think that this is because there is
      relatively a lot of flexibility in the Lyapunov conditions -- if you can
      find one function which is a Lyapunov function for the system, then there
      are also many "nearby" functions which will satisfy the same
      constraints. This is the fundamental benefit of <a href="#HJB">changing the equality in the HJB into an inequality in Lyapunov analysis</a>.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Region of attraction estimation for polynomial systems</h1>

      <p>Now we have arrived at the tool that I believe can be a work-horse for
      many serious robotics applications.  Most of our robots are not actually
      globally stable. That's not because they are robots -- if you push me
      hard enough, I will fall down, too! Asking for global stability is too
      much, but we can instead certify that our closed-loop systems behave well
      over a sufficiently large region of state space (and potentially for a
      range of possible parameters or disturbances). One of the simplest
      versions of this is estimating the region of attraction to a fixed
      point.</p>

      <p>Sums-of-squares optimization effectively gives us an oracle which we
      can ask: is this polynomial positive for all $\bx$?  To use this for
      regional analysis, we have to figure out how to modify our questions to
      the oracle so that the oracle will say "yes" or "no" when we ask if a
      function is positive over a certain region which is a subset of $\Re^n$.
      That trick is called the S-procedure.  It is closely related to the
      Lagrange multipliers from constrained optimization, and has deep
      connections to "Positivstellensatz" from algebraic geometry.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>The S-procedure</h1>

        <p>Consider a scalar polynomial, $p(\bx)$, and a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semialgebraic_set">semi-algebraic
        set</a>
        $g(\bx) \le 0$. The term "semi-algebraic set" just means the set is
        defined by polynomial inequalities (here $g(\bx) \le 0$).  If I can
        find a polynomial "multiplier", $\lambda(\bx)$, such that \[ p(\bx) +
        \lambda^T(\bx) g(\bx) \sos, \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda(\bx) \sos,
        \] then this is sufficient to demonstrate that $$p(\bx)\ge 0 \quad
        \forall \bx \in \{ \bx~|~g(\bx) \le 0 \}.$$  To convince yourself,
        observe that when $g(\bx) \le 0$, it is only harder to be positive, but
        when $g(\bx) > 0$, it is possible for the combined function to be SOS
        even if $p(\bx)$ is negative.  We will sometimes find it convenient to
        use the short-hand: $$g(\bx) \le 0 \Rightarrow p(\bx) \ge 0$$ to denote
        the implication certified by the S-procedure, e.g. whenever $g(\bx) \le
        0$, we have $p(\bx) \ge 0.$</p>

        <p>We can also handle equality constraints with only a minor
        modification -- we no longer require the multiplier to be positive. If
        I can find a polynomial "multiplier", $\lambda(\bx)$, such that
        \[p(\bx) + \lambda^T(\bx) g(\bx) \sos \] then this is sufficient to
        demonstrate that $$p(\bx)\ge 0 \quad \forall \bx \in \{ \bx | g(\bx) =
        0 \}.$$  Note the difference: for $g(\bx)\le 0$ we needed $\lambda(\bx)
        \ge 0$, but for $g(\bx) = 0$, $\lambda(\bx)$ can be arbitrary.  The
        intuition is that $\lambda(\bx)$ can add arbitrary positive terms to
        help me be SOS, but those terms contribute nothing precisely when
        $g(\bx)=0$.</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Basic region of attraction formulation</h1>

        <p>The S-procedure gives us the tool we need to evaluate positivity
        only over a region of state space, which is precisely what we need to
        certify the Lyapunov conditions for a region-of-attraction analysis.
        Let us start with a positive-definite polynomial Lyapunov candidate,
        $V(\bx) \succ 0$, then we can write the Lyapunov conditions:
        $$\dot{V}(\bx) \prec 0 \quad \forall \bx \in \{ \bx | V(\bx) \le \rho
        \},$$ using sums-of-squares and the S-procedure: $$-\dot{V}(\bx) +
        \lambda(\bx)(V(\bx) - \rho) \text{ is SOS,} \quad \text{and} \quad
        \lambda(\bx) \text{ is SOS},$$ where $\lambda(\bx)$ is a multiplier
        polynomial with free coefficients that are to be solved for in the
        optimization. Note that we've carefully chosen to denote the region of
        interest using a sub-level set of $V(\bx)$, so that we can be sure that
        region is also an invariant set (one of the requirements for the region
        of attraction analysis described above).</p>

        <p>I think it's easiest to see the details in an example.</p>

        <example id="roa_cubic_system"><h1>Region of attraction for the
        one-dimensional cubic system</h1>

          <p>Let's return to our example from above: \[ \dot{x} = -x + x^3 \]
          and try to use SOS optimization to demonstrate that the region of
          attraction of the fixed point at the origin is $x \in (-1,1)$, using
          the Lyapunov candidate $V(x) = x^2.$ </p>

          <p>First, define the multiplier polynomial, \[ \lambda(x) = c_0 + c_1
          x + c_2 x^2. \]  Then define the optimization \begin{align*}
          \find_{\bf c} \quad & \\  \subjto \quad& - \dot{V}(x) + \lambda(x)
          (V(x)-1) \sos \\ & \lambda(x) \sos \end{align*} </p>

          <p>You can try these examples for yourself in <drake></drake>.</p>

          <script>document.write(notebook_link('lyapunov', "cubic_poly"))</script>

        </example>

        <p>In this example, we only verified that the one-sublevel set of the
        pre-specified Lyapunov candidate is negative (certifying the ROA that
        we already understood).  More generally, we can replace the 1-sublevel
        set with any constant value $\rho$. It is tempting to try to make
        $\rho$ a decision variable that we could optimize, but this would make
        the optimization problem non-convex because we would have terms like
        $\rho c_0$, $\rho c_1 x$, which are bilinear in the decision variables.
        We need the sums-of-squares constraints to be only linear in the
        decision variables.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, because the problem is convex with $\rho$ fixed (and
        therefore can be solved reliably), and $\rho$ is just a scalar, we can
        perform a simple <i>line search</i> on $\rho$ to find the largest value
        for which the convex optimization returns a feasible solution.  This
        will be our estimate for the region of attraction.</p>

        <p>There are a number of variations to this basic formulation; I will
        describe a few of them below.  There are also important ideas like
        rescaling and degree-matching that can have a dramatic effect on the
        numerics of the problem, and potentially make them much better for the
        solvers.  But you do not need to master them all in order to use the
        tools effectively.</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>The equality-constrained formulation</h1>

        <p>Here is one important variation for finding the level set of a
        candidate region of attraction, which turns an inequality in the
        S-procedure into an equality.  This formulation <i>is</i> jointly
        convex in $\lambda(\bx)$ and $\rho$, so one can optimize them in a
        single convex optimization.  It appeared informally in an example in
        <elib>Parrilo00</elib>, and was discussed a bit more in
        <elib>Shen20</elib>.</p>

        <p>Under the assumption that the Hessian of $\dot{V}(\bx)$ is
        negative-definite at the origin (which is easily checked), we can write
        \begin{align*} \max_{\rho, \lambda(\bx)} & \quad \rho \\ \subjto &
        \quad (\bx^T\bx)^d (V(\bx) - \rho) + \lambda^T(\bx) \dot{V}(\bx) \text{
        is SOS},\end{align*} with $d$ a fixed positive integer.  As you can
        see, $\rho$ no longer multiplies the coefficient of $\lambda(\bx)$. But
        why does this certify a region of attraction?</p>

        <p>You can read the sums-of-squares constraint as certifying the
        implication that whenever $\dot{V}(x) = 0$, we have that either $V(\bx)
        \ge \rho$ OR $\bx = 0$.  Multiplying by some multiple of $\bx^T\bx$ is
        just a clever way to handle the "or $\bx=0$" case, which is necessary
        since we expect $\dot{V}(0) = 0$.  This implication is sufficient to
        prove that $\dot{V}(\bx) \le 0$ whenever $V(\bx) \le \rho$, since $V$
        and $\dot{V}$ are smooth polynomials; we examine this claim in full detail in <a href="#van_der_pol_roa">one of the exercises</a>.</p>

        <p>Using the S-procedure with equalities instead of inequalities has
        the immediate advantage of removing the SOS constraint on
        $\lambda(\bx).$  But there is a more subtle, and likely more important
        advantage -- we have more mathematical tools for dealing with algebraic
        varieties (defined by equality constraints) than for the semi-algebraic
        sets (defined by inequality constraints). For an important example of
        how this can be used to dramatically simplify the SOS programs, see for
        instance <elib>Shen20</elib> which uses sampling on the variety to
        provide an exact certification (for all $\bx$) on the quotient ring,
        completely removing the need for the Lagrange multiplier terms.</p>

        <example id="max_roa_cubic_system"><h1>Maximizing the ROA for the cubic
        polynomial system</h1>

          <p>Let's return again to our example from above: \[ \dot{x} = -x +
          x^3 \] and try to use SOS optimization, this time to maximize the
          sub-level set of our Lyapunov candidate $V(x) = x^2,$ in order to
          certify the largest ROA that we can using these tools.</p>

          <p>Again, we define the multiplier polynomial, $\lambda(x)$, but this
          time we won't require it to be sums-of-squares (here it's a "free"
          polynomial). Then define the optimization \begin{align*} \max_{\rho}
          \quad & \\  \subjto \quad& x^2 (V(x)-\rho) - \lambda(x)\dot{V}(x)
          \sos. \end{align*} What degree should we choose for $\lambda(x)$
          here? Note that $V(x)$ has degree 2, so $x^2V(x)$ has degree 4, and
          $\dot{V}(x)$ also has degree 4, so it's possible that even a
          zero-degree $\lambda(x)$ (just a constant) can be sufficient here.
          Our numerical experiments confirm that this is indeed the case:</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Searching for $V(\bx)$</h1>

        <p>The machinery so far has used optimization to find the largest
        region of attraction that can be certified <i>given a candidate
        Lyapunov function</i>.  This is not necessarily a bad assumption.  For
        most stable fixed points, we can certify the local stability with a
        linear analysis, and this linear analysis gives us a candidate
        quadratic Lyapunov function that can be used for nonlinear analysis
        over a region.  Practically speaking, when we solve an LQR problem, the
        cost-to-go from LQR is a good candidate Lyapunov function for the
        nonlinear system.  If we are simply analyzing an existing system, then
        we can obtain this candidate by solving a Lyapunov equation (Eq
        \ref{eq:algebraic_lyapunov}).</p>

        <p>Recall that there are cases when the stability of the linearization
        is not informative about the stability of the nonlinear system (if the
        linearization has only non-negative eigenvalues instead of strictly
        negative). Can we use our nonlinear tools to certify a region of
        attraction for these systems, even when the linearization doesn't yield
        a candidate Lyapunov function?  Or perhaps we can certify a larger
        volume of state space by optimizing our original Lyapunov candidate to
        maximize the volume of the verified region for the nonlinear system,
        potentially even considering Lyapunov functions with degree greater
        than two (the linear analysis will only give quadratic candidates)?
        Yes. We can use sums-of-squares optimization in those cases, too!</p>

        <p>To accomplish this, we'll combine the ideas from our global
        stability analysis (where we could search for $V(\bx)$) with these new
        tools for regional analysis (where so far we had to fix $V(\bx)$).  Make
        $V(\bx)$ a polynomial (of some fixed degree) with the coefficients as
        decision variables.  First we will need to add constraints to ensure
        that $$V({\bf 0}) = 0 \quad {and} \quad V(\bx) - \epsilon \bx^T\bx
        \text{ is SOS},$$ where $\epsilon$ is some small positive constant.
        This $\epsilon$ term simply ensures that $V$ is strictly positive
        definite. Now let's consider our basic formulation: 
        
        $$-\dot{V}(\bx) + \lambda(\bx)(V(\bx) - 1) {\text{ is SOS}}, \quad 
        \text{and} \quad \lambda(\bx) \text{ is SOS}.$$
        
        Notice that I've substituted $\rho=1$; now that we are searching for
        $V$ the scale of the level-set can be set arbitrarily to 1.  In fact,
        it's better to do so -- if we did not set $V(0)=0$ and $V(\bx) \le 1$
        as the sublevel set, then the optimization problem would be
        under constrained.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the derivative constraint is now nonconvex (bilinear)
        in the decision variables, since we are searching for both the
        coefficients of $\lambda$ and $V$, and they are multiplied together.
        The equality-constrained formulation has the same bilinearity, since
        the coefficients of $V$ also appear in $\dot{V}$.  Here we have to
        resort to some weaker form of optimization.  In practice, we have had
        good practical success (see, for instance
        <elib>Tedrake10+Majumdar16a</elib>) using bilinear alternations: 
        <ol>
          <li>Fix $V(\bx)$ and solve for $\rho$ and $\lambda(\bx)$:
          \begin{align*} \max_{\rho, \lambda(\bx)} & \quad \rho \\ \subjto &
          \quad (\bx^T\bx)^d (V(\bx) - \rho) + \lambda^T(\bx) \dot{V}(\bx)
          \text{ is SOS},\end{align*} with $d$ a fixed, positive integer.
          Update $V(\bx) \Leftarrow \frac{V(\bx)}{\rho}.$
        </li> 
        <li>Fix $\lambda(\bx)$ and solve for $V(\bx) = \bx^T{\bf P}\bx$:
        \begin{align*} \min_{{\bf P}} & \quad \tr({\bf P}) \\ \subjto & \quad
        (\bx^T\bx)^d (V(\bx) - 1) + \lambda^T(\bx) \dot{V}(\bx) \text{ is SOS},
        \\ & \quad {\bf P} \succeq 0. \end{align*} with $d$ the same fixed,
        positive integer.
        </li>
        </ol>
        These alternations require a feasible initial $V(\bx)$, which we
        typically get from solving the quadratic Lyapunov equation or LQR. We
        often prefer to do those optimizations in the equality-constrained
        formulation, because we have stronger tools for dealing with that
        equality constraint <elib>Shen20</elib>, but the basic formulation with
        line search can be used, too, and in some problems can be numerically
        more robust.</p>

        <p>Where did the $\tr(\bf{P})$ objective come from?  A typical choice
        for the objective of the alternations is to maximize the volume of the
        certified region -- for quadratic Lyapunov functions described in our
        standard quadratic form, $\bx^T {\bf P} \bx \le 1$, this volume is
        proportional to $\det({\bf P}^{-\frac{1}{2}}).$ Minimizing this volume
        is a convex optimization<elib part="&sect;8.4.1">Boyd04a</elib>, but
        maximizing the volume is, in general, not.  We tend to use a heuristic
        like minimizing $\tr(\hat{\bf P}^{-1}{\bf P})$ as a surrogate for the
        true objective <elib part="&sect;6.3.2">Posa17a</elib>, where $\hat{\bf
        P}$ is the ${\bf P}$ from a previous alternation of the algorithm (or
        the identity matrix that I've written above), which is a linearization
        of the true objective<elib>Fazel03</elib>. For higher-degree Lyapunov
        functions, typically we (approximately) maximize the volume of a
        contained ellipse, $$\bx^T {\bf P} \bx \le 1 \Rightarrow V(\bx) \le
        1,$$ as a surrogate for the true volume.</p>

        <p>Barring numerical issues, this algorithm is guaranteed to have
        recursive feasibility and tends to converge in just a few alternations,
        but there is no guarantee that it finds the optimal solution.</p>

          <h1>Estimated regions of attraction need not be convex regions (in
          state space)</h1>

          <p>Although we are using convex optimization to find regions of
          attraction, this does not imply that the regions we are certifying
          need to be convex.  To demonstrate that, let's make a system with a
          known, non-convex region of attraction.  We'll do this by taking some
          interesting potential function, $U(\bx)$ is SOS, and setting the
          dynamics to be $$\dot{\bx} = (U(\bx)-1) \frac{\partial U}{\partial
          \bx}^T,$$ which has $U(x) <= 1$ as the region of attraction.</p>

          <p>Slightly more general is to write $$\dot{\bx} = (U(\bx)-1) {\bf
          R}(\theta) \frac{\partial U}{\partial \bx}^T,$$ where ${\bf R}(\theta)
          = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ -\sin\theta &
          \cos\theta\end{bmatrix}$ is the 2D rotation matrix, and $\theta<\pi$
          is a constant parameter (not a decision variable nor indeterminate),
          which still has the same region of attraction.</p>

          <p>Searching for Lyapunov functions of only degree 2 (quadratics)
          will, of course, limit our certified regions to convex regions.  But
          if we increase the degree of the Lyapunov function to degree 4, then
          we can tighten our inner approximation, and indeed certify non-convex
          regions. While we can use the Lyapunov method for linear systems to
          initialize quadratic Lyapunov functions, the ability to search for
          the parameters of the Lyapunov functions really shines when the
          Lyapunov candidates are higher degree (such as the quartic we use
          here).</p>

      <subsubsection id="outer_roa"><h1>Convex outer approximations</h1>

        <p>All of our region of attraction approximations so far have been
        "inner approximations" -- the certified region is guaranteed to be
        contained within the true region of attraction for the system.  This is
        what we want if we are to give some guarantee of stability.  As we
        increase the degree of our polynomial and multipliers, we expect that
        the estimated regions of attraction will converge on the true
        regions.</p>

        <p>It turns out that if we instead consider outer approximations, which
        converge on the true ROA from the other side, we can write formulations
        that enable searching for the Lyapunov function directly as a convex
        optimization.  As we will see below, this approach also allows one to
        write convex formulations for controller design.  These methods have
        been explored in a very nice line of work by Henrion and Korda (e.g.
        <elib>Henrion14</elib>), using the method of moments from
        <elib>Lasserre10</elib> also called "occupation measures".  Their
        treatment emphasizes infinite-dimensional linear programs and
        heirarchies of LMI relaxations; these are just dual formulations to the
        SOS optimizations that we've been writing here.  I find the SOS form
        more clear, so will stick to it here.  Some of the occupation measure
        papers include the dual formulation of the infinite-dimension linear
        program which will look quite similar; my coauthors and I typically
        call out the sums-of-squares version in our papers on the topic (e.g.
        <elib>Posa17</elib>).</p>

        <p>To find an outer approximation, instead of solving for a Lyapunov
        function that certifies convergence to the origin, we instead search
        for a Lyapunov-like "<a href="#barrier">barrier certificate"</a>,
        $\mathcal{B}(\bx).$  Like a Lyapunov function, we'd like
        $\dot{\mathcal{B}}(\bx) \leq 0$; this time we'll ask for this to be
        true everywhere (or at least in some set that is sufficiently larger
        than the ROA of interest).  Then we will set $\mathcal{B}(0) = 1 > 0$.  If
        we can find such a function, then certainly any state for which
        $\mathcal{B}(\bx) < 0$ is outside of the region of attraction of the
        fixed point -- since $\mathcal{B}$ cannot increase it can never reach
        the origin which has $\mathcal{B} > 0.$  The <i>super</i>level set $\{
        \bx | \mathcal{B}(\bx) \ge 0\}$ is an outer approximation of the true
        region of attraction: $$-\dot{\mathcal{B}}(\bx) \text{ is SOS} \quad
        \text{and} \quad \mathcal{B}(0) = 1.$$</p>

        <p>In order to find the smallest such outer approximation (given a
        fixed degree polynomial), we choose an objective that tries to
        "push-down" on the value of $\mathcal{B}(\bx)$.  We typically
        accomplish this by introducing another polynomial function $W(\bx)$
        with the requirements that $$W(\bx) \ge 0  \quad \text{and} \quad
        W(\bx) \ge \mathcal{B}(\bx) +1,$$ implemented as SOS constraints.  Then
        we minimize the integral $\int_\bx W(\bx)d\bx$, which can be readily
        computed over a compact set like a ball in $\Re^n$
        <elib>Folland01</elib> and is linear in the coefficients.  More
        sophisticated alternatives also exist<elib>Henrion09</elib>. <elib
        sect="Ch.~4">Majumdar16a</elib> writes the objective as minimizing the
        volume of the covering ellipse, which is convex<elib
        part="&sect;8.4.1">Boyd04a</elib>.</p>

        <example><h1>Outer approximation for the cubic polynomial</h1>

          <p>Let's revisit my favorite scalar dynamical system, $\dot{x} = -x +
          x^3,$ which has a region of attraction for the fixed point at zero of
          $\{x \| |x|< 1 \}.$  This time, we'll estimate the ROA using the
          outer approximation.  We can accomplish this with the following
          program: \begin{align*} \min_{\mathcal{B}(x), W(x)} \quad &
          \int_{-2}^2 W(x)dx, \\ \subjto \quad & -\dot{\mathcal{B}}(x) &
          \text{is SOS}, \\ & W(x) &\text{ is SOS}, \\ & W(x) - \mathcal{B}(x)
          - 1.0 & \text{ is SOS}, \\ & \mathcal{B}(0)= 0.1.\end{align*}</p>

          <p>To make the problem a little numerically better, you'll see in the
          code that I've asked for $\dot{\mathcal{B}}(x)$ to be strictly
          negative definite, and I've chosen to only include even-degree
          monomials in $\mathcal{B}(x)$ and $W(x)$. Plotting the solution
          reveals:</p>

          <div  style="text-align:center"><img
            src="data/cubic_polynomial_outer_approx.svg" width="500px"/></div>

          <p>As you can see, the superlevel set, $\mathcal{B}(x) \ge 0$ is a
          tight outer-approximation of the true region of attraction.  In the
          limit of increasing the degrees of the polynomials to infinity, we
          would expect that $W(\bx)$ would converge to the indicator function
          that is one inside the region of attraction, and zero outside (we are
          quite far from that here, but nevertheless have a tight approximation
          from $\mathcal{B}(\bx) \ge 0$).</p>

          <script>document.write(notebook_link('lyapunov', notebook="outer_approx"))</script>

          <p>Go ahead and try adjusting some of these decisions. For example,
          if you set $B(0)=1$, then you can increase the degree of $B(x)$ to
          get tighter and tighter approximations.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Regions of attraction codes in Drake</h1>

        <p>In <drake></drake>, we have packaged most of the work in setting up
        and solving the sums-of-squares optimization for regions of attraction
        into a single method <code>RegionOfAttraction(system, context,
        options)</code>, which aims to implement the best methods described in
        this chapter.</p>

        <example><h1>RegionOfAttraction for the cubic polynomial</h1>

          <p>Using the <code>RegionOfAttraction</code> method, many of the notebooks above can be reduced to just a few lines:</p>

          <pre><code class="python">x = Variable("x")
sys = SymbolicVectorSystem(state=[x], dynamics=[-x+x**3])
context = sys.CreateDefaultContext()
V = RegionOfAttraction(sys, context)
          </code></pre>

          <script>document.write(notebook_link('lyapunov', "cubic_poly"))</script>

          <p>Remember that although we have tried to make it convenient to call
          these functions, they are not a black box.  I highly recommend
          opening up the code implementing the <code>RegionOfAttraction</code>
          method and understanding how it works (even if you don't love C++,
          the <code>MathematicalProgram</code> modeling language in Drake makes
          these formulations pretty readable). There are lots of different
          options / formulations, and numerous numerical recipes to improve the
          numerics of the optimization problem.</p>
        </example>

        <p>In order to develop our intuition for these tools, it is helpful to
        understand how "tight" the inner approximation can be for each choice
        of the fixed degree of the Lyapunov function / Lagrange multipliers.
        I've included below a few of my favorite examples of nonlinear systems
        which use some clever construction to have <i>known</i> regions of
        attraction.</p>

        <example><h1>Region of attraction for the time-reversed Van der Pol oscillator</h1>

          <p>We will study the Van der Pol oscillator in more detail when we
          study limit cycles. For now, it suffices to know that the dynamics
          are polynomial, and that the stable limit cycle of the system when
          simulated forward in time produces a known (via numerical
          integration) boundary for the region of attraction of the fixed point
          at the origin when we simulate the system <i>backwards</i> in
          time.</p>

          <todo>Figure here</todo>

          <script>document.write(notebook_link('lyapunov', "van_der_pol"))</script>

          <p>I've provided an example here for solving this problem with the
          <code>RegionOfAttraction</code> in Drake, but we will also work you
          through writing the sums-of-squares problem yourself in the <a
          href="#van_der_pol_roa">exercises</a>.</p>

        </example>

        <example><h1>Regions of attraction and LQR</h1>
        
          <p>So far we have only considered verifying regions of attraction for
          systems of the form $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx)$ (e.g. with no control
          input); the implication has been that one should design a feedback
          controller first and then analyze the stability of the closed-loop
          dynamics. But some control design techniques produce artifacts that
          can be useful for this verification. Often jointly designing a
          controller and certificate can be more tractable than trying to
          certify an arbitrary controller.</p>

          <p>One nice example of this that we've already seen is the linear
          quadratic regulator.  Even when it is applied to (the linearization
          of) nonlinear systems, it still produces a quadratic cost-to-go
          function $\bar\bx^T {\bf S} \bar\bx$ which can be immediately used as
          a candidate Lyapunov function for the nonlinear system.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Rigid-body dynamics are (rational) polynomial</h1>

      <p>We've been talking a lot in this chapter about numerical methods for
      polynomial systems.  But even our simple pendulum has a $\sin\theta$ in
      the dynamics.  Have I been wasting your time?  Must we just resort to
      polynomial approximations of the non-polynomial equations?  It turns out
      that our polynomial tools can perform exact analysis of the manipulation
      equation for almost all<sup>&dagger;</sup><sidenote><sup>&dagger;</sup>the most notable
      exception to this is if your robot has helical/screw joints (see
      <elib>Wampler11</elib>).</sidenote>of our robots.  We just have to do a
      little more work to reveal that structure.</p>

      <p>Let us first observe that rigid-body kinematics are polynomial (except
      the helical joint).  This is fundamental -- the very nature of a "rigid
      body" assumption is that Euclidean distance is preserved between points on
      the body; if $\bp_1$ and $\bp_2$ are two points on a body, then the
      kinematics enforce that $|\bp_1 - \bp_2|_2^2$ is constant -- these are
      polynomial constraints.  Of course, we commonly write the kinematics in a
      minimal coordinates using $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$.  But because of
      rigid body assumption, these terms only appear in the simplest forms, and
      we can simply make new variables $s_i = \sin\theta_i, c_i = \cos\theta_i$,
      and add the constraint that $s_i^2 + c_i^2 = 1.$  For a more thorough
      discussion see, for instance, <elib>Wampler11</elib> and
      <elib>Sommese05</elib>. Since the potential energy of a multi-body system
      is simply an accumulation of weight times the vertical position for all of
      the points on the body, the potential energy is polynomial.<p>

      <p>If configurations (positions) of our robots can be described by
      polynomials, then velocities can as well: forward kinematics $\bp_i =
      f(\bq)$ implies that $\dot\bp_i = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \bq}\dot\bq,$
      which is polynomial in $s, c, \dot\theta$.  Since the kinetic energy of
      our robot is given by the accumulation of the kinetic energy of all the
      mass, $T = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} m_i v_i^Tv_i,$ the kinetic energy is
      polynomial, too (even when we write it with inertial matrices and angular
      velocities).</p>

      <p>Finally, the <a href="multibody.html">equations of motion</a> can be
      obtained by taking derivatives of the Lagrangian (kinetic minus
      potential). These derivatives are still polynomial!</p>

      <example id="ex:global_pend"><h1>Global stability of the simple pendulum
        via SOS</h1>

        <p> We opened this chapter using our intuition about energy to discuss
        stability on the simple pendulum. Now we'll replace that intuition with
        convex optimization (because it will also work for more difficult
        systems where our intuition fails).</p>

        <p>Let's change coordinates from $[\theta,\dot\theta]^T$ to $\bx =
        [s,c,\dot\theta]^t$, where $s \equiv \sin\theta$ and $c \equiv
        \cos\theta$.  Then we can write the pendulum dynamics as $$\dot\bx =
        \begin{bmatrix} c \dot\theta \\ -s \dot\theta \\ -\frac{1}{m l^2}
        \left( b \dot\theta + mgls \right) \end{bmatrix}.$$
        </p>

        <p>Now let's parameterize a Lyapunov candidate $V(s,c,\dot\theta)$ as
        the polynomial with unknown coefficients which contains all monomials
        up to degree 2:  $$V = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 s + \alpha_2 c + ...
        \alpha_{9} s^2 + \alpha_{10} sc + \alpha_{11} s\dot\theta.$$ Now we'll
        formulate the feasibility problem: \[ \find_{\bf \alpha} \quad  \subjto
        \quad V \sos, \quad -\dot{V} \sos.\] In fact, this is asking too much
        -- really $\dot{V}$ only needs to be negative when $s^2+c^2=1$.  We can
        accomplish this with the S-procedure, and instead write \[ \find_{{\bf
        \alpha},\lambda} \quad  \subjto \quad V \sos, \quad -\dot{V}
        -\lambda(\bx)(s^2+c^2-1) \sos.\] (Recall that $\lambda(\bx)$ is another
        polynomial with free coefficients which the optimization can use to
        make terms arbitrarily more positive when $s^2+c^2 \neq 1$.) Finally,
        for style points, in the code example in <drake></drake> we ask for
        exponential stability:</p>

        <script>document.write(notebook_link('lyapunov', "global_pend"))</script>

        <p>As always, make sure that you open up the code and take a look.  The
          result is a Lyapunov function that looks familiar (visualized as a
          contour plot here):</p>

        <div  style="text-align:center"><img
            src="figures/pend_global_sos.svg" width="400px"/></div>

        <p>Aha!  Not only does the optimization finds us coefficients for the
        Lyapunov function which satisfy our Lyapunov conditions, but the result
        looks a lot like mechanical energy.  In fact, the result is a little
        better than energy... there are some small extra terms added which prove
        exponential stability without having to invoke LaSalle's Theorem.</p>

      </example>

      <p>The one-degree-of-freedom pendulum did allow us to gloss over one
      important detail: while the manipulator equations $\bM(\bq) \ddot{\bq} +
      \bC(\bq, \dot\bq)\dot{\bq} = ...$ are polynomial, in order to solve for
      $\ddot{\bq}$ we actually have to multiply both sides by $\bM^{-1}$.  This,
      unfortunately, is <i>not</i> a polynomial operation, so in fact the final
      dynamics of the multibody systems are <i>rational</i> polynomial.  Not
      only that, but evaluating $\bM^{-1}$ symbolically is not advised -- the
      equations get very complicated very fast.  But we can actually write the
      Lyapunov conditions using the dynamics in implicit form, e.g. by writing
      $V(\bq,\dot\bq,\ddot\bq)$ and asking it to satisfy the Lyapunov conditions
      everywhere that $\bM(\bq)\ddot\bq + ... = ... + {\bf B}\bu$ is
      satisfied, using the S-procedure.</p>

      <subsubsection id="trig_quadratic"><h1>Linear feedback and quadratic
      forms</h1>

        <p>There are a few things that <i>do</i> break this clean polynomial
        view of the world.  Rotary springs, for instance, if modeled as $\tau =
        k (\theta_0 - \theta)$ will mean that $\theta$ appears alongside
        $\sin\theta$ and $\cos\theta$, and the relationship between $\theta$
        and $\sin\theta$ is sadly <i>not polynomial</i>.  As we have presented
        it so far, even linear feedback from LQR actually looks like a linear
        spring.</p> 
        
        <p>Looking more closely, though, there is a natural alternative.
        Consider the mechanical energy of the simple pendulum , $E =
        \frac{1}{2}ml^2 \dot\theta^2 + mgl(1- \cos\theta),$ where we've taken
        the potential energy so that $E \ge 0$).  Observe that using half-angle
        formulas  we can write this as a quadratic form: $$E = \frac{1}{2}
        \begin{bmatrix} 2\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ \dot\theta \end{bmatrix}^T
        \begin{bmatrix} mgl & 0 \\ 0 & ml^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
        2\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) \\ \dot\theta \end{bmatrix}.$$  The term $2
        \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})$ has slope one at $\theta = 0$. This isn't
        unique to the pendulum, $2\sin^2(\frac{\theta}{2})$ is a natural choice
        for a Lyapunov candidate in the trigonometric coordinates that is
        periodic in $2\pi.$  In the case of LQR applied to the linearization of
        a nonlinear mechanical system, one could replace $-k \theta$ with $-2 k
        \sin(\frac{\theta}{2})$; after all their linearization is the same.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Alternatives for obtaining polynomial equations</h1>

        <p>In practice, you can also Taylor approximate any smooth nonlinear
        function using polynomials.  This can be an effective strategy in
        practice, because you can limit the degrees of the polynomial, and
        because in many cases it is possible to provide conservative bounds on
        the errors due to the approximation.</p>

        <p id="stereographic">One final technique that is worth knowing about
        is a change of coordinates, often referred to as the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection">
        stereographic projection</a>, that provides a coordinate system in which
        we can replace $\sin$ and $\cos$ with polynomials:

          <figcaption>The stereographic projection.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        By projecting onto the line, and using similar triangles, we find that
        $p = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}.$  Solving for $\sin\theta$ and
        $\cos\theta$ reveals $$\cos\theta = \frac{1-p^2}{1+p^2}, \quad
        \sin\theta = \frac{2p}{1+p^2}, \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\partial
        p}{\partial \theta} = \frac{1+p^2}{2},$$ where $\frac{\partial
        p}{\partial \theta}$ can be used in the chain rule to derive the
        dynamics $\dot{p}$.  Although the equations are rational, they share
        the denominator $1+p^2$ and can be treated efficiently in mass-matrix
        form.  Compared to the simple substitution of $s=\sin\theta$ and
        $c=\cos\theta$, this is a minimal representation (scalar to scalar, no
        $s^2+c^2=1$ required); unfortunately it does have a singularity at
        $\theta=\pi$, so likely cannot be used for global analysis.</p>

    <subsection id="implicit"><h1>Verifying dynamics in implicit form</h1>

      <p>Typically we write our differential equations in the form $\dot\bx =
      {\bf f}(\bx, \bu).$  But let us consider for a moment the case where the
      dynamics are given in the form $${\bf g}(\bx, \bu, \dot\bx ) = 0.$$ This
      form is strictly more general because I can always write ${\bf
      g}(\bx, \bu, \dot\bx) = f(\bx \bu) - \dot\bx$, but importantly here I can
      also write the bottom rows of ${\bf g}$ as $\bM(\bq)\ddot\bq +
      \bC(\bq,\dot\bq)\dot\bq - \btau_g - \bB \bu$.  This form can also
      represent <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential-algebraic_system_of_equations">differential
      algebraic equations (DAEs)</a> which are more general than ODEs; $\bg$
      could even include algebraic constraints like $s_i^2 + c_i^2 - 1$.  Most
      importantly, for manipulators, ${\bf g}$ can be polynomial, even if ${\bf
      f}$ would have been rational.  <drake></drake> provides access to
      continuous-time dynamics in implicit form via the <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_system.html#a2bb4c1e3572a8009863b5a342fcb5c49"><code>CalcImplicitTimeDerivativesResidual</code></a>
      method.</p>

      <p>We typically write a linear system in implicit form as $${\bf
      E}\dot\bx = \bA\bx + \bB\bu.$$ Systems in this form are particularly
      interesting when ${\bf E}$ is singular, and are known as descriptor
      systems, semistate systems, generalized state-space systems or just
      singular systems (c.f. <elib>Mehrmann91</elib>).  Just like our standard
      approach to linearization, we can potentially obtain the matrices ${\bf
      E}, \bA, \bB$ from a first-order Taylor approximation of the nonlinear
      equations in ${\bf g}(\bx,\dot\bx,\bu).$  When it comes to Lyapunov
      analysis, linear systems are often analyzed using the so-called
      "generalized Lyapunov equation".</p> 
      
      <theorem><h1>Lyapunov analysis for implicit linear systems</h1>

        <p>Given a linear system in the form ${\bf E}\dot\bx = \bA\bx,$ the
        origin is asymptotically stable if there exists a matrix ${\bf P}$ such
        that $${\bf P} = {\bf P}^T \succ 0, \quad \bA^T {\bf P}{\bf E} + {\bf
        E}^T {\bf P} \bA \prec 0.$$ Furthermore, if such a ${\bf P}$ exists,
        then we can obtain one by solving the <i>generalized Lyapunov
        equation</i>: $$\bA^T {\bf P}{\bf E} + {\bf E}^T {\bf P} \bA = -{\bf
        Q},$$ for any ${\bf Q} \succ 0$ <elib part="Ch 4">Stykel02</elib>.
        </p>

      </theorem>

      <p>This can be verified by taking $$V(\bx) = \bx^T {\bf E}^T {\bf P}{\bf
      E} \bx,$$ as the Lyapunov function.  A corresponding approach can be used
      (e.g. via sums-of-squares) for implicit nonlinear systems like our
      manipulator equations where ${\bf g}(\bx,\dot\bx)=0$ can be written in
      the form ${\bf E}(\bx) \dot\bx = {\bf f}(\bx).$ </p>
      <todo>Flesh this out and add an example.  $V(\bx) = \bx^T {\bf E}^T(\bx)
      {\bf P}{\bf E}(\bx) \bx$ seems a natural choice of Lyapunov candidates. V
      = v'M(q)'PM(q)v + q'Qq could bea natural form for manipulators (do I need
      q-v cross terms?); it looks a bit like kinetic energy...</todo>

      <p>Alternatively, we can check the Lyapunov conditions, $\dot{V}(\bx) \le
      0$, directly on a system in its implicit form, $\bg(\bx,\dot\bx)=0$.
      Simply define a new function $Q(\bx, \bz) = \frac{\partial
      V(\bx)}{\partial \bx} \bz.$ If we can show $Q(\bx, \bz) \le 0, \forall
      \bx,\bz \in \{ \bx, \bz | \bg(\bx,\bz) = 0 \}$ using SOS, then we have
      verified that $\dot{V}(\bx) \le 0$, albeit at the non-trivial cost of
      adding indeterminates $\bz$ and an additional S-procedure.</p>

      <p>To combine the trigonometric substitutions with the implicit form for
      a simple second-order system (where the number of positions is equal to
      the number of velocities), we use ${\bf z}$ to represent the implicit
      $\ddot{\bq}$ and convert \begin{gather*} V(\bq, \dot\bq) \Rightarrow
      V({\bf s}, {\bf c}, \dot\bq) \\ {\bf g}(\bq, \dot\bq, {\bf z})
      \Rightarrow {\bf g}({\bf s}, {\bf c}, \dot\bq, {\bf z}), \end{gather*}
      and write the Lyapunov conditions using $\dot{V} = \sum_i \pd{V}{s_i} c_i
      \dot{q}_i - \sum_i \pd{V}{c_i}s_i \dot{q}_i + \pd{V}{\dot\bq} \bz.$  The
      most common case for the number of positions is not equal to the number
      of velocities is when we deal with 3D rotations represented by unit
      quaternions; this case can be handled using the implicit form, too (we
      use the implicit form to relate $\dot{q}$ to the velocities and verify
      the Lyapunov conditions only on the manifold defined by the quaternion
      unit norm constraint).</p>

  <section id="finite-time"><h1>Finite-time Reachability</h1>

    <p>So far we have used Lyapunov analysis to analyze <i>stability</i>, which
    is fundamentally a description of the system's behavior as time goes to
    infinity.  But Lyapunov analysis can also be used to analyze the
    finite-time behavior of nonlinear systems.  We will see a number of
    applications of this finite-time analysis over the next few chapters.  It
    can be applied even to unstable systems, or systems that are stable to a
    limit cycle instead of a fixed-point.  It can also be applied to systems
    that are only defined over a finite interval of time, as might be the case
    if we are executing a planned trajectory with a bounded duration.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Time-varying dynamics and Lyapunov functions</h1>

      <p>Before focusing on the finite time, let us first realize that the
      basic (infinite-time) Lyapunov analysis can also be applied to
      time-varying systems: $\dot{\bx} = f(t, \bx).$  We can analyze the
      stability (local, regional, or global) of this system with very little
      change.  If we find \begin{gather*}V(\bx) \succ 0, \\
      \forall t,\forall \bx \ne 0, \quad \dot{V}(t, \bx) = \pd{V}{\bx}f(t,\bx) < 0, \quad
      \dot{V}(t, 0) = 0, \end{gather*} then all of our previous
      statement still hold.  In our SOS formulations, $t$ is simply one more
      indeterminate.</p>

      <p>Similarly, even for a time-invariant system, it is also possible to
      define a time-varying Lyapunov function, $V(t, \bx)$ and establish local,
      regional, or global stability using the almost the same conditions:
      \begin{gather*}\forall t, \forall \bx \ne 0, \quad V(t, \bx) > 0, \quad V(t, 0) = 0, \\
      \forall t, \forall \bx \ne 0, \quad \dot{V}(t, \bx) = \pd{V}{\bx}f(\bx) + \pd{V}{t} < 0,
      \quad \dot{V}(t, 0) = 0. \end{gather*} </p>

      <p>These two ideas each stand on their own, but they very often go
      together, as time-varying dynamics are perhaps the best motivator for
      studying a time-varying Lyapunov function.  Afterall, we do know that a
      stable time-invariant system must have a time-invariant Lyapunov function
      that demonstrates this stability (from the "converse Lyapunov function"
      theorems).  But we do not know apriori how to represent this function; as
      an example, remember we know that there are stable polynomial systems
      that cannot be verified with a polynomial Lyapunov function.  For global
      stability analysis, the time-varying Lyapunov analysis does not add
      modeling power: since the conditions must be satisfied for all $t$, we
      could have just set $t$ to a constant and used the time-invariant
      function.  But there may be cases where a time-varying analysis could
      afford a different analysis for the regional or local stability cases. We
      will see a good example of this when we study limit cycles.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Finite-time reachability</h1>

      <p>Finite-time reachability analysis is an important concept for control
      design and verification, where we seek to understand the behavior of a
      system over only a finite time interval, $[t_1, t_2]$.  It is almost
      always a region-based analysis, and attempts to make a statement of the
      form: $$\bx(t_1) \in \mathcal{X}_1 \Rightarrow \bx(t_2) \in
      \mathcal{X}_2,$$  where $\mathcal{X}_1, \mathcal{X}_2 \subset \Re^n$ are
      regions of state space.  More generally, we might like to understand the
      time-varying reachable set $\forall t\in [t_1, t_2], \mathcal{X}(t).$
      </p>

      <p><i>Reachability analysis</i> can be done forward in time: we choose
      $\mathcal{X}_1$ and try to find the <i>smallest</i> region
      $\mathcal{X}_2$ for which we can make the statement hold.
      $\mathcal{X}(t)$ would be called the <i>forward-reachable set</i> (FRS),
      and can be very useful for certifying e.g. a motion plan.  For instance,
      you might like to prove that your UAV does not crash into a tree in the
      next 5 seconds.  In this case $\mathcal{X}_1$ might be take to be a point
      representing the current state of the vehicle, or a region representing
      an outer-approximation of the current state if the state in uncertain. In
      this context, we would call $\mathcal{X}_2$ a forward-reachable set. In
      this use case, we would typically choose any approximations in our
      Lyapunov analysis to certify that an estimate of the reachable region is
      also an outer-approximation: $\mathcal{X}_2 \subseteq
      \hat{\mathcal{X}}_2.$</p>

      <p>Reachability analysis can also be done backward in time: we choose
      $\mathcal{X}_2$ and try to <i>maximize</i> the region $\mathcal{X}_1$ for
      which the statement can be shown to hold.  Now $\mathcal{X}(t)$ is called
      the <i>backward-reachable set</i> (BRS), and for robustness we typically
      try to certify that our estimates are an inner-approximation,
      $\hat{\mathcal{X}}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{X}_1.$  The region-of-attraction
      analysis we studied above can be viewed as a special case of this, with
      $\mathcal{X}_2$ taken to be the fixed-point, $t_2 = 0$ and $t_1 =
      -\infty$.  But finite-time BRS also have an important role to play, for
      instance when we are composing multiple controllers in order to achieve a
      more complicated task, which <a
      href="feedback_motion_planning.html"></a>we will study soon</a>.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Reachability via Lyapunov functions</h1>

      <p>Lyapunov functions can be used to certify finite-time reachability,
      even for continuous-time systems.  The basic recipe is to certify the
      Lyapunov conditions over a (potentially time-varying) invariant set. Once
      again, we typically represent this as a (time-varying) level set of the
      Lyapunov function containing the origin, $V(\bx) \le \rho(t),$ where
      $\rho(t)$ is now a positive scalar function of time. Since we already
      have time as a decision variable, we can easily accommodate time-varying
      dynamics and Lyapunov functions, as well, so: \begin{align*} \forall
      t\in[t_1, t_2], \quad \forall \bx, \qquad& V(t,\bx) > 0, \quad& V(t, 0) =
      0 \\ \forall t \in [t_1, t_2], \quad \forall \bx \in \{\bx | V(t,\bx) =
      \rho(t)\}, \qquad& \dot{V}(t, x) \le \dot\rho(t).\end{align*}  Note that
      finite-time reachability is about proving invariance of the set, not
      stability, and the $\dot{V}$ condition need only be certified at the
      boundary of the level set.  If $V$ is decreasing at the boundary, then
      trajectories can never leave.  One can certainly ask for more -- we may
      want to show that the system is converging towards $V(t,\bx) = 0$,
      perhaps even at some rate -- but only invariance is required to certify
      reachability.
      </p>

      <p>Again, for polynomial systems and dynamics, sums-of-squares
      optimization is a powerful tool for certifying these properties
      numerically, and optimizing the volume of the estimated regions.  Having
      taken $t$ as an indeterminate, we can use the S-procedure again to
      certify the conditions $\forall t \in [t_1, t_2].$</p>

      <p>Like in the case for region of attraction, we have many formulations.
      We can certify an existing Lyapunov candidate, $V(t,\bx)$, and just try
      to maximize/minimize $\rho(t)$.  Or we can search for the parameters of
      $V(t,\bx)$, too.  Again, we can initialize that search using the
      time-varying version of the Lyapunov equation, or the solutions to a
      time-varying LQR Riccati equation.</p>

      <p>In practice, we often certify the Lyapunov conditions over $\bx$ at
      only a finite set of samples $t_i \in [t_1, t_2]$.  I don't actually have
      anything against sampling in one dimension; there are no issues with
      scaling to higher dimensions, and one can make practical rigorous
      statement about bounding the sampling error.  And in these systems,
      adding $t$ into all of the equation otherwise can dramatically increase
      the degree of the polynomials required for the SOS certificates.  All of
      this was written up nicely in <elib>Tobenkin10b</elib>, and robust
      variants of it were developed in <elib>Majumdar16a</elib>.</p>

  <section id="control"><h1>Control design</h1>

    <p>Throughout this chapter, we've developed some very powerful tools for
    reasoning about stability of a closed-loop system (with the
    controller already specified).  I hope you've been asking yourself -- can I
    use these tools to design better controllers?  Of course the answer is
    "yes!".  In this section, I'll discuss the control approaches that are the
    most direct consequences of the convex optimization approaches to Lyapunov
    functions.  Another very natural idea is to use these tools in the content
    of a feedback motion planning algorithm, which is the subject of an <a
    href="feedback_motion_planning.html">upcoming chapter</a>.</p>

    <subsection id="control_alternations"><h1>Control design via
    alternations</h1>

      <p>For linear optimal control, we found controllers of the form, $\bu =
      -\bK \bx.$  The natural generalization of this to polynomial analysis
      will be to look for controllers of the form $\bu = \bK(\bx)$, where
      $\bK(\bx)$ is a polynomial vector.  (For mechanical systems like the
      pendulum above, we might make $\bK(x)$ polynomial in $s$ and $c$.)</p>

      <subsubsection id="global_control_alternations"><h1>Global stability</h1>

        <p>If we apply this control directly to the Lyapunov conditions for
        global analysis with control-affine dynamics, we quickly see the
        problem. We have $$\dot{V}(\bx) = \pd{V}{\bx}\left[ {\bf f}_1(\bx) +
        {\bf f}_2(\bx) \bK(\bx)\right],$$ and as a result if we are trying to
        search for the parameters of $V$ and $\bK$ simultaneously, the decision
        variables multiply and the problem will be non-convex.</p>

        <p>One very natural strategy is to use alternations.  The idea is
        simple, we will fix $\bK$ and optimize $V$, then fix $V$ and optimize
        $\bK$ and repeat until convergence.  This approach has roots in the
        famous "DK iterations" for robust control (e.g.
        <elib>Lind94</elib>).</p>

        <p>For this approach, it is important to start with an initial feasible
        $V$ or $\bK$.  For example, one can think of locally stabilizing a
        nonlinear system with LQR, and then searching for a linear control law
        (or even a higher-order polynomial control law) that achieves a larger
        basin of attraction.  But note that once we move from global stability
        to region of attraction optimization, we now need to alternate between
        three sets of variables: $V(\bx), \bK(\bx), \lambda(\bx),$ where
        $\lambda(\bx)$ was the multiplier polynomial for the S-procedure.  We
        took exactly this approach in <elib>Majumdar13</elib>.  In that paper,
        we showed that alternations could increase the certified region of
        attraction for the Acrobot.</p>

        <p>The alternation approach takes advantage of a structured convex
        optimization in each step of the alternations, but it is still only a
        local approach to solving the non-convex joint optimization.  It is
        subject to local minima. The primary advantage is that, barring
        numerical issues, we expect recursive feasibility (once we have a
        controller and Lyapunov function that achieves stability, even with a
        small region of attraction, we will not lose it) and monotonic
        improvement on the objective.  It is also possible to attempt to
        optimize these objectives more directly with other non-convex
        optimization procedures (like stochastic gradient descent, or
        sequential quadratic programming <elib>Shen20</elib>), but strict
        feasibility is harder to guarantee. Oftentimes the Lyapunov conditions
        are just evaluated at samples, or along sample trajectories.  However,
        once we "learn" a Lyapunov candidate even by approximate methods, we
        may once again attempt to rigorously certify the Lyapunov conditions
        using just a single convex optimization step the with controller
        fixed.</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Maximizing the region of attraction</h1>
      
        <p>An extension of this approach can be used to design controllers that
        are certified only over a region of attraction, but this requires some
        additional care. We can write the search for the
        maximal region of attraction as: \begin{align*} \max_{\rho, {\bf
        K}(\bx), V(\bx), \lambda(\bx)}& \qquad \rho \\ \subjto \quad
        & V(\bx),~\lambda(\bx) \text{ are SOS,} \\ & -\pd{V}{\bx} ({\bf
        f}_{1}(\bx) + {\bf f}_{2}(\bx){\bf K}(\bx)) + \lambda(\bx)( V(\bx) -
        \rho) \text{ is SOS,} \\ & V({\bf 0}) = 0, \quad V({\bf 1}) = 1.
        \end{align*} The last line yields linear constraints which simply fixes
        the scaling of $V(\bx).$</p>
    
        <p>Once again, we find that this optimization is bilinear in the
        decision variables. But the conditions are linear in $\lambda(\bx)$ and
        ${\bf K}(\bx)$ for fixed $V(\bx)$, and are linear in $V(\bx)$ for fixed
        $\lambda(\bx)$ and ${\bf K}(\bx)$. In principle, we could use bilinear
        alternations, but <elib>Majumdar13</elib> recommended a three-way
        alternation approach in order to include a step which explicitly
        optimizes ${\bf K}(\bx)$ with an objective of maximizing $\rho.$
        Starting with an initial guess for $V(\bx)$ we can repeat the following
        alternations:
        <ol>
          <li>Fix $V(\bx)$ and $\rho$, and solve a feasibility problem for
          ${\bf K}(\bx)$ and $\lambda(\bx):$ \begin{align*}
          \textbf{find}_{\lambda(\bx), {\bf K}(\bx)}& \\ \subjto \qquad&
          -\pd{V}{\bx} ({\bf f}_{1}(\bx) + {\bf f}_{2}(\bx){\bf K}(x)) +
          \lambda(\bx)( V(\bx) - \rho) \text{ is SOS.} \end{align*}
        </li> 
          <li>Fix $V(\bx)$ and $\lambda(\bx)$ and maximize $\rho$ searching
          over ${\bf K}(\bx):$ \begin{align*} \max_{\rho, {\bf K}(\bx)}\qquad &
          \rho \\ \subjto \qquad & \lambda(\bx) \text{ is SOS} \\ &
          -\pd{V}{\bx} ({\bf f}_{1}(\bx) + {\bf f}_{2}(\bx){\bf K}(x)) +
          \lambda(\bx)( V(\bx) - \rho) \text{ is SOS.} \end{align*}    </li>
          <li>Fix $\lambda(\bx)$ and ${\bf K}(\bx)$ and maximize $\rho$ <!--
          wouldn't it be better to maximize volume here, like in our search
          over V above? -->
          searching over $V(\bx):$         \begin{align*} \max_{\rho,
          V(\bx)}\qquad & \rho \\ \subjto \qquad & V(\bx) \text{ is SOS} \\ &
          -\pd{V}{\bx} ({\bf f}_{1}(\bx) + {\bf f}_{2}(\bx){\bf K}(x)) +
          \lambda(\bx)( V(\bx) - \rho) \text{ is SOS,} \\ & V({\bf 0}) = 0,
          \quad V({\bf 1}) = 1. \end{align*}  </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        </subsubsection>

    </subsection>

    <subsection id="PQ"><h1>State feedback for linear systems</h1>

      <p>There is a clever reparameterization of the original problem that can
      make the co-design of Lyapunov functions and stabilizing controllers
      jointly convex in some cases.</p>

      <p>Let's re-examine the Lyapunov conditions for linear systems from Eq.
      \ref{eq:lyap}, but now add in a linear state feedback $\bu = \bK\bx$,
      resulting in the closed-loop dynamics $\dot{\bx} = (\bA + \bB\bK)\bx.$
      One can show that the set of all stabilizing $\bK$ can be characterized
      by the following two matrix inequalities <elib>Boyd94</elib>: \[{\bf P} =
      {\bf P}^T \succ 0, \qquad {\bf P}(\bA + \bB\bK) + (\bA + \bB\bK)^T{\bf P}
      \prec 0. \]  Unfortunately, these inequalities are <i>bilinear</i> in the
      decision variables, ${\bf P}$ and $\bK$, and therefore non-convex.  It
      turns out that we can turn these into <i>linear</i> matrix inequalities
      (LMIs) through a simple change of coordinates, $\bQ = {\bf P}^{-1}, {\bf
      Y} = \bK{\bf P}^{-1}$, resulting in \[ \bQ = \bQ^T \succ 0, \qquad \bA\bQ
      + \bQ\bA^T + \bB{\bf Y} + {\bf Y}^T \bB^T \prec 0. \]  Furthermore, given
      matrices $\bA$ and $\bB$, there exists a matrix $\bK$ such that $(\bA +
      \bB\bK)$ is stable if and only if there exist matrices $\bQ$ and ${\bf
      Y}$ which satisfy this (strict) linear matrix inequality.</p>

      <todo>The robust state-feedback design for polytopic uncertainty example
      from LMIsinSYSTEMSCONTROL.pdf (in Zotero) by Denis ARZELIER essentially
      combines this with the linear common-lyapunov function example. </todo>

      <todo>Make a new subsection for this and add an example.</todo>
      <p>For global stability, there is a nice extension of this using sums of
      squares <elib>Prajna04b</elib>
      to the case of $$\dot{\bx} = {\bf f}_1(\bx){\bf m}(\bx) + {\bf
      f}_2(\bx)\bu,$$ where ${\bf m}(\bx)$ is a vector of monomials with ${\bf
      m}(\bx)=0$ iff $\bx=0$, and the elements of ${\bf f}_1(\bx)$ and ${\bf
      f}_2$ are polynomial. The search is over polynomial feedback controllers
      of the form $\bu = \bK(\bx){\bf m}(\bx).$</p>

    </subsection>
    
    <subsection id="control-lyapunov"><h1>Control-Lyapunov Functions</h1>

      <p>Another core idea connecting Lyapunov analysis with control design is
      the "<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Lyapunov_function">control-Lyapunov
      function</a>".  Given a system $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx, \bu)$, a
      control-Lyapunov function $V$ is a positive-definite function for which
      $$\forall \bx \neq 0, \exists \bu \quad \dot{V}(\bx,\bu) = \pd{V}{\bx}
      f(\bx, \bu) < 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \exists \bu \quad \dot{V}(0, \bu)
      = 0.$$  In words, for all $\bx$, there exists a control input that would
      allow the $V$ to decrease.  Once again, we adorn this basic property with
      extra conditions (e.g. radially unbounded, or satisfied over a control-
      invariant set) in order to construct global or regional stability
      statements.  What is important to understand is that we can design
      control-Lyapunov functions without explicitly parametrizing the
      controller; often the control action is not even determined until
      execution time by finding a particular $\bu$ that goes downhill.</p>

      <p>Our sums-of-squares toolkit is well-suited for addressing questions
      with the $\forall$ quantifier over indeterminates.  Working with the
      $\exists$ quantifier is much more difficult; we don't have an
      S-procedure-like solution for it.  Interestingly, there is one approach
      that we've discussed above that effectively turns the $\exists$ into a
      $\forall$ -- that is the outer approximation approach to region of
      attraction analysis.</p>

      <p>In the outer-approximation, we produce a barrier certificate to find
      the set of states where the controller cannot go (for any $\bu$).  Our
      barrier certificate now has the form $$\forall \bx, \forall \bu, \quad
      \dot{\mathcal{B}}(\bx, \bu) \le 0.$$  Certainly, $\mathcal{B}(\bx) \ge 0$
      is now an outer-approximation of the true "backward-reachable set" (BRS)
      of the fixed point <elib>Henrion14+Korda13</elib>.  Again
      <elib>Posa17</elib>
      has some nice examples of this written directly in sums-of-squares
      form.</p>

      <p>Now here is where it gets a little frustrating.  Certainly, sublevel
      sets of $\mathcal{B}(\bx)$ are control-invariant (via the proper choice
      of $\bu$).  But we do not (cannot) expect that the entire estimated
      region (the 0-superlevel set) can be rendered invariant.  The estimated
      region is an <i>outer</i> approximation of the backward reachable set.
      <todo>it's more than that... \dot{B}=0 happens somewhere in the interior,
      and it's conservative due to the forall u.</todo>
      <elib>Majumdar13b</elib> gave a recipe for extracting a polynomial
      control law from the BRS; an inner approximation of this control law can
      be obtained via the original SOS region of attraction tools.  This is
      unfortunatley suboptimal/conservative.  Although we would like to
      certify the control-Lyapunov conditions directly in an inner
      approximation, the $\exists$ quantifier remains as an obstacle.</p>

    </subsection>

    <!-- Do I need a separate section on density functions / occupation
    measures?  I mention them in the outer approximation above... -->

    <subsection id="adp"><h1>Approximate dynamic programming with SOS</h1>

      <p>We have <a href="#HJB">already established</a> the most important
      connection between the HJB conditions and the Lyapunov conditions:
      $$\dot{J}^*(\bx)  = -\ell(\bx,\bu^*) \qquad \text{vs} \qquad \dot{V}(\bx)
      \preceq 0.$$  The HJB involves solving a complex PDE; by changing this to
      an inequality, we relax the problem and make it amenable to convex
      optimization.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Upper and lower bounds on cost-to-go</h1>

        <p>Asking for $\dot{V}(\bx) \preceq 0$ is sufficient for proving
        stability.  But we can also use this idea to provide rigorous
        certificates as upper or lower bounds of the cost-to-go.  Given a
        control-dynamical system $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx, \bu)$, and a fixed
        controller $\pi(\bx)$ we can find a function $V(\bx)$: <ul><li>$\forall
        \bx, \dot{V}^\pi(\bx) \le -\ell(\bx,\pi(\bx))$ to provide an <b>upper
        bound</b>, or </li> <li>$\forall \bx, \dot{V}^\pi(\bx) \ge
        -\ell(\bx,\pi(\bx))$ to provide an <b>lower bound</b>.</li></ul>To see
        this, take the integral of both sides along any <i>solution</i>
        trajectory, $\bx(t), \bu(t)$.  For the upper-bound we get
        \begin{gather*} \int_0^\infty \dot{V}^\pi(\bx) dt = V^\pi(\bx(\infty))
        - V^\pi(\bx(0)) \le \int_0^\infty -\ell(\bx(t),\pi(\bx(t)))
        dt.\end{gather*}  Assuming $V^\pi(\bx(\infty)) = 0$, we have
        $$V^\pi(\bx(0)) \ge \int_0^\infty \ell(\bx(t),\pi(\bx(t))) dt.$$</p>

        <p>The upper bound is the one that we would want to use in a
        certification procedure -- it provides a <i>guarantee</i> that the
        total cost achieved by the system started in $\bx$ is less than
        $V(\bx)$.  But it turns out that the lower bound is much better for
        control design. This is because we can write $$\forall \bx, \min_\bu [
        \ell(\bx,\bu) + \pd{V}{\bx}f(\bx,\bu) ] \ge 0 \quad \equiv \quad
        \forall \bx, \forall \bu, \ell(\bx,\bu) + \pd{V}{\bx}f(\bx,\bu) \ge
        0.$$  Therefore, without having to specify apriori a controller, if we
        can find a function $V(\bx)$ such that $\forall \bx, \forall \bu,
        \dot{V}(\bx, \bu) \ge -\ell(\bx,\bu)$, then we have a lower-bound on
        the <i>optimal</i> cost-to-go.</p>

        <p>You should take a minute to convince yourself that, unfortunately,
        the same trick does not work for the upper-bound. Again, we would need
        $\exists$ as the quantifier on $\bu$ instead of $\forall$.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Linear Programming Dynamic Programming</h1>

        <p>In the dynamic programming chapter, we introduced the <a
        href="dp.html#lp_dp">linear programming approach to dynamic
        programming</a>. This was exactly using the idea of pushing up on a
        lower bound on the cost-to-go. In the case of a discrete state, then
        this lower bound will be tight (and we obtain the true cost-to-go
        function); in the case of linear function approximators, then we hope
        for a tight lower bound.</p>
  
      </subsubsection>
  
      <subsubsection id="sos_dp"><h1>Sums-of-Squares Dynamic
      Programming</h1>
  
        <p>The linear programming approach works natively in discrete (or
        sampled) time/state/action settings.  Sums-of-squares provides the a
        beautiful extension to continuous time/state/actions.</p>
  
        <p>In the simple case, let us assume that $f(\bx,\bu)$ and
        $\ell(\bx,\bu)$ are polynomials (this assumption is discussed at length
        in the Lyapunov chapter).  We can search for a polynomial
        $\hat{J}_\alpha(\bx)$ which satisfies the HJB inequality $$\forall \bx,
        \forall \bu, \quad 0 \le \ell(\bx,\bu) + \pd{\hat{J}_\alpha}{\bx}
        f(\bx,\bu),$$ using the following <i>convex</i> optimization:
        \begin{align*} \max_\alpha & \int_{\bf X} \hat{J}_\alpha(\bx) d\bx \\
        \subjto \quad & \ell(\bx,\bu) + \pd{\hat{J}_\alpha}{\bx} f(\bx,\bu)
        \text{ is SOS }(\forall \bx, \forall \bu) \\ & \hat{J}_\alpha({\bf 0})
        = 0. \end{align*} Since $\hat{J}_\alpha(\bx)$ is polynomial, the
        integral objective (over a bounded domain of interest) can be computed
        exactly, and is still linear in the coefficients $\alpha$. As in the
        linear programming approach, here the SOS constraint ensures that
        $\hat{J}$ is a <i>lower</i> bound on the cost to go, and the objective
        "pushes up" on this lower bound. As we increase the degree of the
        polynomial representing $\hat{J}$, we expect better and better
        approximations of the true cost-to-go.</p>

        large number around $x=2\pi$). We should be able to improve the
        numerics dramatically by choosing more intelligent polynomial bases.  I
        personally think this method has a lot of offer and it would be very
        interesting to see how far it could go with mature implementations.</p>

      <p>
        Suppose that we are given a dynamical system $\dot \bx = f(\bx)$ with 
        continuous $f$ that is globally exponentially stable to $\bx^*$ -- i.e., 
        there exist positive constants $C$ and $\alpha$, such that for any initial

        $||\bx(t)-\bx^*|| < Ce^{-\alpha t} ||\bx(0)-\bx^*||$.

    <exercise><h1>Gradient Flow in Euclidean Space</h1>

      $\ell(x)$. The gradient flow is a continuous-time analog of gradient
      descent and is defined as $\dot{x} = -\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial x}$.

    <exercise><h1>Control-Lyapunov Function for a Wheeled Robot</h1>

      <p>In this exercise, we examine the idea of a <a
      href="#control-lyapunov">control-Lyapunov function</a>
      to drive a wheeled robot, implementing the controller proposed in
      <elib>Aicardi95</elib>.</p>

      <p>Similar to <a href="intro.html#wheeled_robot">this previous
      example</a>, we use a kinematic model of the robot.  We represent with
      $z_1$ and $z_2$ its Cartesian position and with $z_3$ its orientation.
      The controls are the linear $u_1$ and angular $u_2$ velocities.  The
      equations of motion read \begin{align*} \dot z_1 &= u_1 \cos z_3, \\ \dot
      z_2 &= u_1 \sin z_3, \\ \dot z_3 &= u_2.\end{align*}  The goal is to
      design a feedback law $\pi(\bz)$ that drives the robot to the origin
      $\bz=0$ from any initial condition.  As pointed out in
      <elib>Aicardi95</elib>, this problem becomes dramatically easier if we
      analyze it in polar coordinates.  As depicted below, we let $x_1$ be the
      radial and $x_2$ the angular coordinate of the robot, and we define $x_3 =
      x_2 - z_3$.  Analyzing the figure, basic kinematic considerations lead to
      \begin{align*} \dot x_1 &= u_1 \cos x_3, \\ \dot x_2 &= - \frac{u_1 \sin
      x_3}{x_1}, \\ \dot x_3 &= - \frac{u_1 \sin x_3}{x_1} -
      u_2.\end{align*}</p>

        $\dot V_2 (\bx, \pi(\bx)) \leq 0$ for all $\bx$.  (Technically speaking,
        $\pi_2(\bx)$ is not defined for $x_3=0$.  In this case, we let

        that the fixed point is attractive using LaSalle's Theorem and the
        scalar function $V(x)$. </li>

        <li>The swing-up controller is robust with respect to mass measurement.
        Suppose the mass measurement is incorrect $m_i \neq m$. Show that the
        controller can still complete the swing-up task, i.e., the fixed point
        is still attractive.</li>

        <li>Consider the case where both mass and length measurements are
        incorrect, $l_i \neq l$ and $m_i \neq m$. Is the fixed point still
        attractive? If not, identify conditions $m_i, l_i, \dot{\theta},
        \theta, \widetilde{E}$ could satisfy such that $\dot{V} > 0$.</li>

        <li>Suppose in addition to uncertaint mass and length, the
        gravitational constant is also uncertain, $g_i \neq g$. Suppose the
        pendulum's small-oscillation period $T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$ can be
        measured precisely, and the estimated values of length and
        gravitational constant satisfy $T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{l_i}{g_i}}$. Show
        that the controller can still complete the swing-up task, i.e., the
        fixed point is still attractive.</li>

        <li>Suppose we have accurate measurements of mass and length, but now
        the pendulum is damped, i.e., $b \neq 0$, and we have incorrect
        estimates of the damping ratio $b_i \neq b$. Using a swing-up
        controller $u = -k\dot{\theta}\widetilde{E} + b_i \dot{\theta}$, show
        that $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}\widetilde{E}^2$ cannot be used as a Lyapunov
        function to certify attractivity.</li>
