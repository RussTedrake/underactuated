    "The method used in the Atlas footstep planner is proposed [in this paper](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Deits14a.pdf), which formulates the planning task as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. MIQP is a relatively nice class of optimization problems. The [branch and bound algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) allows to solve these problems to global optimality, whenever a solution exists, and it certifies infeasibility otherwise. The drawback, however, is that computation times scale exponentially with the number of integer variables in the problem.\n",

Using perspective functions and bilinear constraints, a mixed-integer convex program formulation of SPP in GCS is proposed [in this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11565), which has tight convex relaxations. In the following, we will transcribe the footstep planning problem to a SPP in GCS, and solve its convex relaxation. Compared to MIQP which requires branch and bound, the convex optimization problem is very computationally efficient and scales well with the complexity of the terrain.\n",

    "Now that we have defined functions that build a terrain of rectangular stepping stones, it is time to construct the graph of convex sets (GCS). For simplicity, we assume that the robot always starts by moving its right foot (at step 0, left foot is stationary), and we also assume the step sequence alternates between two feet. Therefore, the foot sequence is fixed: {Right, Left, Right ...}. Under these assumptions, the footstep planning task is reduced to finding a path that connects the starting position $x_s \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ (center of \"initial\" stone) to the goal position $x_t\\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ (center of \"goal\" stone) through a sequence of points $\\{x_k\\}_{k=1}^N$ ($N$ is the total number of steps) where each point lies within an available stepping stones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add Vertices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by defining vertices of the GCS. Notice that each stepping stone is a rectangle, which is a convex set. Following that idea, the convex sets, or the vertices, in GCS include: all stepping stones; and the source and the target sets. The source and the target sets correspond to point sets (singleton) that include the starting position $x_s$ and goal position $x_t$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to kinematic constraints, at every time step, one foot has to be within a square centered at the other foot, i.e., $$\\forall k = 1, 2, ..., N-1, |x_k[0] - x_{k+1}[0]|\\leq d/2, |x_k[1] - x_{k+1}[1]|\\leq d/2$$ where $d$ is the `step_span`. Therefore, it is possible that the robot has to step on the same stepping stone more than once. For example, consider the above terrain, if the robot walks across the \"lateral\" stone with a small `step_span`, it might take multiple steps to get across.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in GCS, constructing a single vertex for a single stone would not allow multiple $x_k$ to exist on that single stone. Therefore, suppose we want to have positions of multiple steps on the same stone, e.g., $x_k, x_{k+1}, x_{k+2} \\in S_i$, these variables cannot share the same convex set. To accomodate for such requirements, we need to make copies of the same convex sets to create multiple continuous decision variables. Specifically, we make `m` copies of the same stone where `m = floor(stone_horizontal_length/step_span) + 2`. (Reasons for choosing this number is explained below the vertex naming convention)\n",

Since the only purpose of the copies is to provide multiple position variables inside the same set, we can define a fixed order of these copies, namely `xi_0 -> xi_1 -> ... -> xi_m`. For minimum number of steps (or minimum distance of edges on the path), the robot will only step on the same stone multiple times consecutively (not coming back to a stone once it leaves said stone). The choice of `m` ensures that even for a narrow stone where `m = 0 + 2`, the robot has the ability to place both feet on the stone so that it can position itself better to reach the next stone if needed. Additionally, if the robot needs to get across a wider stone in several steps, minimum number of steps require the robot to take as large step as possible, therefore, `m = floor(stone_horizontal_length/step_span)+2`. It is easier to add these edges while creating vertices, as demonstrated by the code template implemented for the \"lateral\" stone.\n",

In this case, using convex relaxation, the result will contain numerical solutions for decision variables including: continuous variable in each vertex and edge flow variables. The edge flow variables `e.phi()` is a continuous variable between 0 and 1, which is a relaxed version of binary variable that takes value 0 or 1.
