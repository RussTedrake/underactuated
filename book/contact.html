<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 16"><h1>Planning and
Control through Contact</h1>

  <p>So far we have developed a fairly strong toolbox for planning and control
  with "smooth" systems -- systems where the equations of motion are described
  by a function $\dot{\bx} = f(\bx,\bu)$ which is smooth everywhere.  But our
  <a href="simple_legs.html">discussion of the simple
  models of legged robots</a> illustrated that the dynamics of making and
  breaking contact with the world are more complex -- these are often modeled
  as hybrid dynamics with impact discontinuities at the collision event and
  constrained dynamics during contact (with either soft or hard
  constraints).</p>

  <p>My goal for this chapter is to extend our computational tools into this
  richer class of models.  Many of our core tools still work: trajectory
  optimization, Lyapunov analysis (e.g. with sums-of-squares), and LQR all have
  natural equivalents.</p>

  <p>Let's start with a warm-up exercise: trajectory optimization for the rimless wheel.  We already have basically everything that we need for this, and it will form a nice basis for generalizing our approach throughout the chapter.</p>

  <example id="rimless"><h1>Trajectory optmization for the rimless wheel</h1>

    <figure>
      <img width="40%" src="figures/rimlessWheel.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The rimless wheel. The orientation of the stance leg,
      $\theta$, is measured clockwise from the vertical axis. </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The <a href="simple_legs.html#rimless_wheel">rimless wheel</a> was our
    simplest example of a passive-dynamic walker; it has no control inputs but
    exhibits a passively stable rolling fixed point.  We've also <a
    href="limit_cycles.html">already seen</a> that trajectory optimization can
    be used as a tool for finding limit cycles of a smooth passive system, e.g.
    by formulating a direct collocation problem: \begin{align*}
    \find_{\bx[\cdot],h} \quad \subjto \quad & \text{collocation
    constraints}(\bx[n], \bx[n+1], h), \quad \forall n \in [0, N-1] \\ & \bx[0]
    = \bx[N], \\ & h_{min} \le h \le h_{max},\end{align*} where $h$ was the
    time step between the trajectory break points.</p>

    <p>It turns out that applying this to the rimless wheel is quite straight
    forward.  We still want to find a periodic trajectory, but now have to take
    into account the collision event.  We can do this by modifying the
    periodicity condition.  Let's force the initial state to be just after the
    collision, and the final state to be just before the collision, and make
    sure they are related to each other via the collision equation:
    \begin{align*} \find_{\bx[\cdot],h} \quad \subjto \quad & \text{collocation
    constraints}(\bx[n], \bx[n+1], h), \quad \forall n \in [0, N-1] \\ &
    \theta[0] = \gamma - \alpha, \\ & \theta[N] = \gamma + \alpha, \\ &
    \dot\theta[0] = \dot\theta[N] \cos(2\alpha)\\ & h_{min} \le h \le h_{max}.
    \end{align*}  Although it is likely not needed for this simple example
    (since the dynamics are sufficiently limited), for completeness one should
    also add constraints to ensure that none of the intermediate points are in
    contact, $$\gamma - \alpha \le \theta[n] < \gamma + \alpha, \quad \forall n
    \in [1,N-1].$$</p>

    <p>The result is a simple and clean numerical algorithm for finding the
    rolling limit cycle solution of the rimless wheel.  Please take it for a
    spin:</p>

    <script>document.write(notebook_link('contact', 'rimless_wheel'))</script>

  </example>

  <p>The specific case of the rimless wheel is quite clean.  But before we apply
  it to the compass gait, the kneed compass gait, the spring-loaded inverted
  pendulum, etc, then we should stop and figure out a more general form.</p>

  <section><h1>(Autonomous) Hybrid Systems</h1>
  
    <p>Recall how we modeled the dynamics of the simple legged robots. First, we
    derived the equations of motion (independently) for each possible contact
    configuration -- for example, in the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP)
    model we had one set of equations governing the $(x,y)$ position of the mass
    during the flight phase, and a completely separate set of equations written
    in polar coordinates, $(r,\theta)$, describing the stance phase.  Then we
    did a little additional work to describe the transitions between these
    models -- e.g., in SLIP we transitioned from flight to stance when the foot
    first touches the ground.  When simulating this model, it means that we have
    a discrete "event" which occurs at the moment of foot collision, and an
    immediate discontinuous change to the state of the robot (in this case we
    even change out the state variables).</p>
  
    <p>The language of <i>hybrid systems</i> gives us a rich language for
    describing systems of this form, and a suite of tools for analyzing and
    controlling them.  The term "hybrid systems" is a bit overloaded, here we
    use "hybrid" to mean both discrete- and continuous-time, and the particular
    systems we consider here are sometimes called <i>autonomous</i>
    hybrid systems because the internal dynamics can cause the discrete changes
    without any exogeneous input<sup>&dagger;</sup><sidenote><sup>&dagger;</sup>This is in contrast
    to, for instance, the model of a power-train where a change in gears comes
    as an external input.</sidenote>.  In the hybrid systems formulation, we describe a system by a set of <i>modes</i> each described by (ideally
    smooth) continuous dynamics, a set of <i>guards</i> which here are
    continuous functions whose zero-level set describes the conditions which
    trigger an event, and a set of <i>resets</i> which describe the discrete
    update to the state that is triggered by the guard.  Each guard is
    associated with a particular mode, and we can have multiple guards per mode.
    Every guard has at most one reset.  You will occasionally hear guards
    referred to as "witness functions", since they play that role in simulation,
    and resets are sometimes referred to as "transition functions".</p>

    <p>The imagery that I like to keep in my head for hybrid systems is
    illustrated below for a simple example of a robot's heel striking the
    ground.  A solution trajectory of the hybrid system has a continuous
    trajectory inside each mode, punctuated by discrete updates when the
    trajectory hits the zero-level set of the guard (here the distance between
    the heel and the ground becomes zero), with the reset describing the
    discrete change in the state variables.</p>

    <figcaption>Modeling contact as a hybrid system.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>For this robot foot, we can decompose the dynamics into distinct modes: (1) foot in the air, (2) only heel on the ground, (3) heel and toe on the ground, (4) only toe on the ground (push-off). More generally, we will write the dynamics of mode $i$ as ${\bf f}_i$, the guard which signals the transition mode $i$ to mode $j$ as ${\bf \phi}_{i,j}$ (where $\phi_{i,j}(\bx_i) > 0$ inside mode $i$), and the reset map from $i$ to $j$ as ${\bf \Delta}_{i,j}$, as illustrated in the following figure:</p>

    <subsection><h1>Hybrid trajectory optimization</h1>
    
      <p>Using the more general language of modes, guards, and resets, we can
      begin to formulate the "hybrid trajectory optimization" problem.  In
      hybrid trajectory optimization, there is a major distinction between
      trajectory optimization where <i>the mode sequence is known apriori</i>
      and the optimization is just attempting to solve for the
      continuous-time trajectories, vs one in which we must also discover the
      mode sequence.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Given a fixed mode sequence</h1>

        <p>For the case when the mode sequence is fixed, then hybrid trajectory
        optimization can be as simple as stitching together multiple individual
        mathematical programs into a single mathematical program, with the
        boundary conditions constrained to enforce the guard/reset constraints.
        Using the shorthand $\bx_k$ for the state in the $k$th segment of the
        sequence, and $m_k$ for the mode in segment $k$, we can write:
        \begin{align*} \find_{\bx_k[\cdot],h_k} \quad \subjto \quad & \bx_0[0]
        = \bx_0, \\ \forall k, \forall n_k \in [0, N_k-1], \quad &
        \text{collocation constraints}_{m_k}(\bx_k[n_k], \bx_k[n_k+1],
        h_k[n_k]), \\ & h_{min} \le h_k[n_k] \le h_{max}, \\ \forall
        k\in[0,K-1] \quad & \phi_{m_k,m_{k+1}}(\bx_k[N_k]) = 0, \\ &
        \bx_{k+1}[0] = {\bf \Delta}_{m_k,m_{k+1}}(\bx_k[N_k]), \\ \forall k,
        n_k, m \in G \quad & \phi_{m_k,m}(\bx_k[n_k]) > 0. \end{align*} The
        constraints in the last line ensure that no trajectories intersect an
        <i>unscheduled</i> guard, and $G$ is taken to be the tuples of $k,n_k,
        m$ which list all guards and times <i>except</i> the scheduled ones. It
        is then natural to add control inputs (as additional decision
        variables), and to add an objective and any more constraints.
        </p>

        <example><h1>A basketball trick shot.</h1>
        
          <p>As a simple example of this hybrid trajectory optimization, I
          thought it would be fun to see if we can formulate the search for
          initial conditions that optimizes a basketball "trick shot".  A quick
          search turned up <a href="https://youtu.be/Mayx9OrXWIM">this
          video</a> for inspiration.</p>

          <p>Let's start simpler -- with just a "bounce pass".  We can capture
          the dynamics of a bouncing ball (in the plane, ignoring spin) with
          some very simple dynamics: $$\bq = \begin{bmatrix}x \\
          z\end{bmatrix}, \qquad \ddot{\bq} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -g
          \end{bmatrix}.$$  During any time interval without contact of
          duration $h$, we can actually integrate these dynamics perfectly:
          $$\bx(t+h) = \begin{bmatrix} x(t) + h\dot{x}(t) \\ z(t) + h
          \dot{z}(t) - \frac{1}{2}gh^2 \\ \dot{x}(t) \\ \dot{z}(t) - hg
          \end{bmatrix}.$$  With the bounce pass, we just consider collisions
          with the ground, so we have a guard, ${\bf \phi}(\bx) = z,$ which
          triggers when $z=0$, and a reset map which assumes an elastic
          collision with <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution">coefficient
          of restitution</a> $e$: $$\bx^+ = {\bf \Delta(\bx^-)} =
          \begin{bmatrix} x^- & z^- & \dot{x}^- & - e \dot{z}^-
          \end{bmatrix}^T.$$</p>

          <p>We'll formulate the problem as this:  given an initial ball
          position $(x = 0, z = 1)$, a final ball position 4m away $(x=4,
          z=1)$, find the initial velocity to achieve that goal in 5 seconds.
          Clearly, this implies that $\dot{x}(0) = 4/5.$  The interesting
          question is -- what should we do with $\dot{z}(0)$?  There are
          multiple solutions -- which involve bouncing a different number of
          times.  We can find them all with a simple hybrid trajectory
          optimization, using the observation that there are two possible
          solutions for each number of bounces -- one that starts with a
          positive $\dot{z}(0)$ and one with a negative $\dot{z}(0)$.</p>

            <figcaption>Trajectory optimization to find solutions for a "bounce
            pass".  I've plotted all solutions that were found for 2, 3, or 4 bounces... but I think it's best to stick to a single bounce if you're using this on the court.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>Now let's try our trick shot.  I'll move our goal to $x_f = -1m,
          z_f = 3m,$ and introduce a vertical wall at $x=0$, and move our
          initial conditions back to $x_0=-.25m.$  The collision dynamics,
          which now must take into account the spin of the ball, are <a
          href="multibody.html#spinning_ball_bouncing">in the appendix</a>.
          The first bounce is against the wall, the second is against the
          floor.  I'll also constrain the final velocity to be down (have to
          approach the hoop from above).  Try it out.</p>

            the bottom of the net!  The crowd is going wild!</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>In this example, we could integrate the dynamics in each segment
          analytically.  That is the exception, not the rule.  But you can take
          the same steps with a little more code to use, e.g. direct
          transcription or collocation with multiple break points in each
          segment.</p>

        </example>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Direct shooting</h1>

        <p>It is also possible to optimize the trajectory in a single shot by
        taking gradients through the guard/reset map. This method does not
        require an explicit mode sequence, but is prone to having local minima
        (since there is no gradient to "pull" the trajectory towards a guard
        that is not visited along the nominal trajectory).</p>

        <p>In order to achieve this, we need to take the gradient of the cost
        with respect to the trajectory parameters. The methods we've developed
        previously for calculating gradients using the adjoint method (e.g.
        "backpropagation through time") in <a
        href="trajopt.html#backprop_through_time">discrete</a>
        and <a href="trajopt.html#pontryagin_ct">continuous</a> time can be
        combined to handle the hybrid case. The derivation is <i>almost</i> as
        simple as using the continuous adjoint equation to solve (from the
        final time forward) for the continuous modes, and the discrete adjoint
        equation to handle the jump discontinuity. The only detail is that we
        also have to consider variations relative to the contact time; this
        gradient is often referred to as the "Saltation matrix".</p>

        <p>Consider the case of two modes and one transition in our canonical
        hybrid system picture above.  Then one could write the total cost as
        \begin{gather*} J_\balpha = \int_0^{t_c^-} \ell_1(\bx_1, \bu_\balpha)
        dt + \int_{t_c^+}^{t_f} \ell_2(\bx_2, \bu_\balpha) dt,\\ \dot{\bx}_1 =
        {\bf f}_1(\bx_1, \bu_\balpha), \quad \dot{\bx}_2 = {\bf f}_2(\bx_2,
        \bu_\balpha), \quad \bx_2(t_c^+) = {\bf \Delta}_{1,2}(\bx_1(t_c^-)).
        \end{gather*} We wish to take the gradient of $J$ with respect to the
        trajectory parameters, $\alpha$.  The gradient of the first and second
        integrals is exactly the familiar continuous-time case, but the second
        integral must be initialized with $\pd{\bx_2(t_c^+)}{\alpha_i},$ which
        should be related to $\pd{\bx_1(t_c^-)}{\alpha_i}$ via the discrete
        transition. The important point is to capture the dependence of this
        transition not only on $\bx$ but also on $t_c$, which both depend on
        $\balpha.$  Writing it out we have...

    <subsection id="floating_base">
      <h1>Deriving hybrid models: minimal vs floating-base
    coordinates</h1>

      <p>There is some work to do in order to derive the equations of motion in
      this form.  Do you remember how we did it for the <a
      href="simple_legs.html">rimless wheel and compass gait</a> examples?  In
      both cases we assumed that exactly one foot was attached to the ground and
      that it would not slip, this allowed us to write the Lagrangian as if
      there was a pin joint attaching the foot to the ground to obtain the
      equations of motion.  For the SLIP model, we derived the flight phase and
      stance phase using separate Lagrangian equations each with different state
      representations.  I would describe this as the <i>minimal coordinates</i>
      modeling approach -- it is elegant and has some important computational
      advantages that we will come to appreciate in the algorithms below. But
      it's a lot of work!  For instance, if we also wanted to consider friction
      in the foot contact of the rimless wheel, we would have to derive yet
      another set of equations to describe the sliding mode (adding, for
      instance, a prismatic joint that moved the foot along the ramp), plus the
      guards which compute the contact force for a given state and the distance
      from the boundary of the friction cone, and on and on.</p>
    
      <!-- But, actually, it could get more complicated still: in each of the contact modes the foot could be in the static friction regime or could be sliding.  And what if there is rough terrain, so we could make contact at more points.  And what if we -->

      <p>Fortunately, there is an alternative modeling approach for deriving
      the modes, guards, and resets for contact that is more general (though it
      makes the dynamics of each mode a bit more complex).  We can instead
      model the robot in the <i>floating-base coordinates</i> -- we add a
      fictitious six degree-of-freedom "floating-base" joint connecting some
      part of the robot to the world (in planar models, we use just three
      degrees-of-freedom, e.g. $(x,z,\theta)$).  We can derive the equations of
      motion for the floating-base robot once, without considering contact,
      then add the additional constraints that come from being in contact as
      contact forces which get applied to the bodies. The resulting manipulator
      equations take the form \begin{equation}\bM({\bq})\ddot{\bq} +
      \bC(\bq,\dot{\bq})\dot\bq = \btau_g(\bq) + \bB\bu + \sum_i \bJ_i^T(\bq)
      \blambda_i,\end{equation} where $\blambda_i$ are the constraint forces
      and $\bJ_i$ are the constraint Jacobians.  Conveniently, if the guard
      function in our contact equations is the signed distance from contact,
      $\phi_i(\bq)$, then this Jacobian is simply $\bJ_i(\bq) =
      \pd{\phi_i}{\bq}$.  I've written the basic derivations for the common
      cases (position constraints, velocity constraints, impact equations, etc)
      in the
      <a href="multibody.html">appendix</a>. What is important to understand
      here is that this is an alternative formulation for the equations
      governing the modes, guards, and resets, but that is it no longer a
      minimal coordinate system -- the equations of motion are written in $2N$
      state variables but the system might actually be constrained to evolve
      only along a lower dimensional manifold (if we write the rimless wheel
      equations with three configuration variables for the floating base, it
      still only rotates around the toe when it is in stance and is inside the
      friction cone). This will have implications for our algorithms.</p>

      <p>Note that there are some subtleties about using direct collocation
      methods with systems parameterized in the floating-base coordinates with
      additional contact constraints -- the naive implementation of direct
      collocation may not have enough degrees of freedom in the spline to
      satisfy the dynamics constraints exactly at the knot points and the
      collocation points. <elib>Posa15</elib> shows the natural extension of
      direct collocation to constrained systems; and describes more completely
      the advantages of parameterizing contact forces as decision
      variables.</p>

      <p>For completeness, you might also hear the term <i>maximal
      coordinates</i>. This is the extreme case where every rigid body in the
      robot is parameterized with its own floating-base, and even the robot
      joints are implemented as constraints holding the links together. This
      has been used by some notable simulation engines (e.g. the <a
      href="https://www.ode.org/">Open Dynamics Engine</a>), and may have
      advantages for some computational methods. But for our purposes, using
      the dynamics in floating-base coordinates is typically much more
      effective.</p>

      model</a> of running robots, we introduced a surprisingly simple but
      effective approach to achieving a <a
      href="simple_legs.html#slip_control">"deadbeat" controller</a>, with
      control decisions happening just once per cycle. There is a natural
      generalization of this idea to more general hybrid systems...</p>

    <exercise><h1>Finding the compass gait limit cycle</h1>

      <p>In this exercise we use trajectory optimization to identify a limit
      cycle for the compass gait.  We use a rather general approach: the robot
      dynamics is described in floating-base coordinates and frictional contacts
      are accurately modeled.  <script>document.write(notebook_link('contact', 'compass_gait_limit_cycle', link_text='In this notebook'))</script>,
      you are asked to code many of the constraints this optimization
      problem requires:</p>

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Enforce the contact between the stance foot and the ground at all
        the break points.</li>

        <li>Enforce the contact between the swing foot and the ground at the
        initial time.</li>

        <li>Prevent the penetration of the swing foot in the ground at all
        the break points. (In this analysis, we will neglect the scuffing
        between the swing foot and the ground which arises when the swing leg
        passes the stance leg.)</li>

        <li>Ensure that the contact force at the stance foot lies in the 
        friction cone at all the break points.</li>

        <li>Ensure that the impulse generated by the collision of the swing foot
        with the ground lies in the friction cone.</li>

      </ol>
