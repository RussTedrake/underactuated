    "Drake is a powerful modeling language for authoring models of dynamical systems.  The goal of this exercise is to learn how to author a very simple dynamical systems.  To start, take a few minutes to work through [this Drake tutorial](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/notebook/dynamical_systems-b0d6121d894e44d3bef7c169cdf185d1).\n",

    "Your first task is to write a simple *continuous-time* system that implements the dynamics of a simple damped pendulum (with mass, length, and damping set to 1, and gravity set to 10): $$\\ddot\\theta + \\dot\\theta + 10\\sin\\theta = u.$$  Write code into the following block that results in the pendulum_system variable being an *instance* of a Drake System that implements these dynamics using position and velocity as the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You can import `sin` from `numpy` or from `pydrake.math`. Depending on your version of `numpy`, it might print a warning, but this can be safely ignored."

Sometimes the equations depend on time, sometimes not. Sometimes they have extra parameters, sometimes not. Not all systems have inputs, and not all systems have states!\n",

Then all of the methods for the dynamical system can be called using that context, e.g.: $$\\dot{x} = f(\\text{context}), \\qquad y = g(\\text{context}).$$ We'll use it often throughout the course."
