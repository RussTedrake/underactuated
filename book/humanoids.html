<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 4"><h1>Highly-articulated Legged
Robots</h1>

  <p>The passive dynamic walkers and hopping robots described in the last
  chapter capture the fundamental dynamics of legged locomotion -- dynamics
  which are fundamentally nonlinear and punctuated by impulsive events due to
  making and breaking contact with the environment.  But if you start reading
  the literature on humanoid robots, or many-legged robots like quadrupeds, then
  you will find a quite different set of ideas taking center stage: ideas like
  the "zero-moment point" and footstep planning.  The goal of this chapter is to
  penetrate that world.</p>

  <p>Perhaps one of the most surprising thing about the world of complex
  (highly-articulated) legged robots is the dominant use of simple models for
  estimation, planning, and control.  These abstractions become valuable when you have
  enough degrees of freedom to move your feet (approximately) independently from how you
  move your body.</p>

  <p>Since our robots are getting more complicated, I'm going to need a bit
  stronger notation. In Drake we use <a
  href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__notation.html">monogram
  notation</a> and define its spatial algebra <a
  href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#monogram">here for
  kinematics</a>, <a
  href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#jacobian">differential
  kinematics (velocities)</a> and <a
  href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/clutter.html#spatial_force">here for
  force</a>.</p>

  <section><h1>A thought experiment</h1>

    <p>Let's start the discussion with a model that might seem quite far from
    the world of legged robots, but I think it's a very useful way to think
    about the problem.</p>
    
    <subsection><h1>A spacecraft model</h1>

      <todo>Add subscripts to forces on the figure.</todo>
      <figure><img width="50%" src="figures/zmp_thrusters.svg"/></figure>

      <p>Imagine you have a flying vehicle modeled as a single rigid body in a gravity
      field with some number of force "thrusters" attached.  We'll describe the pose of
      the body in the world frame, ${}^WX^B$, parameterized by its position $(x,z)$ and
      orientation $\theta$, and take the center of mass to be at the origin of this body
      frame. The vector from the center of mass to thruster $i$ in the world frame is
      given by ${}^Bp^{B_i}_W$, yielding the equations of motion: \begin{align}
      m\ddot{x} =& \sum_i f^{B_i}_{i, W_x}, \label{eq:spacecraft_x} \\ m\ddot{z} =&
      \sum_i f^{B_i}_{i,W_z} - mg,\label{eq:spacecraft_z}\\ I\ddot\theta =& \sum_i
      \left[ {}^Bp^{B_i}_W(\theta) \times f^{B_i}_{i,W} \right]_y,
      \label{eq:spacecraft_theta}\end{align} where I've used $f^{B_i}_{i,W_x}$ to
      represent the $x$-component of the force applied to $B$ at the location of
      thruster $i$, expressed in the world frame, and we take the $y$-axis component of
      the cross product on the last line. You might compare this to the equations of
      motion for the <a href="acrobot.html#planar_quadrotor">planar quadrotor</a>; the
      only difference is that I've written the force inputs here in world coordinates
      instead of body coordinates.
      </p>

      <p>Our goal is to move the spacecraft to a desired position/orientation and to
      keep it there.  If we take the inputs to be $f^{B_i}_{i,W}$, then the
      translational dynamics are affine (linear plus a constant term). The rotational
      dynamics are nonlinear assuming that the positions of the thrusters rotate with
      the spacecraft. But for small angles, we can stabilize a stabilizable fixed point
      using linearization plus a change of coordinates then LQR, or even plan/track a
      desired trajectory using time-varying LQR.  If I were to add additional linear
      constraints, for instance constraining $f_{min} \le f^{B_i}_{i,W} \le f_{max}$,
      then I can still use linear model-predictive control (MPC) to plan and stabilize a
      desired motion. By most accounts, this is a relatively easy control problem. (If
      we do consider the nonlinear dynamics in $\theta$, then we will resort to
      nonlinear optimization, but this still feels fairly managable).</p>

      <p>Now imagine that you have just a small number of thrusters (let's say
      two) each with severe input constraints.  To make things more
      interesting, let us say that you're allowed to move the thrusters, so
      ${}^B\text{v}^{B_i} = \frac{d}{dt} {}^Bp^{B_i}$ becomes an additional
      control input, but with some important limitations:  you have to turn the
      thrusters off when they are moving (e.g. $f^{B_i}_i = 0$ <i>or</i> ${}^B
      \text{v}^{B_i} = 0$) and there is a limit to how quickly you can
      move the thrusters $|{}^B\text{v}^{B_i}| \le \text{v}_{max}$.  This
      problem is now a lot more difficult, due especially to the fact that
      constraints of the form "$x=0$ or $y=0$"" are non-convex.</p>
      
      <p>I find this a very useful thought exercise; somehow our controller needs to
      make an effectively discrete decision to turn off a thruster and move it.  The
      framework of optimal control should support this - you are sacrificing a
      short-term loss of control authority for the long-term benefit of having the
      thruster positioned where you would like, but we haven't developed tools yet that
      deal well with this discrete plus continuous decision making.  We'll need to
      address that here.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, although the problem is already difficult, we need a few more
      constraints to make it relevant for legged robots.  Now let's say additionally,
      that the thrusters can only be turned on in certain locations (in the world
      frame), as cartooned here:</p>
      
      <figure id="zmp_thrusters_w_regions"><img width="70%"
      src="figures/zmp_thrusters_w_regions.svg"/><figcaption>What if we can
      only apply thrust when the thrusters are in a certain (world)
      position?</figcaption></figure>
      
      <p>Even if the individual regions are convex, the union of these regions
      need not form a convex set.  Furthermore, these locations are often
      expressed in the world frame, not the robot frame, e.g. $${\bf A}\, {}^W
      p^{B_i}_W(\theta) \le {\bf b}.$$</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Robots with (massless) legs</h1>

      <p>In my view, the spacecraft with thrusters problem above is a central
      component of the walking problem.  If we consider a walking robot as our
      single rigid body, $B$, with massless legs, then the feet are exactly
      like movable thrusters.  As above, they are highly constrained - they can
      only produce force when they are touching the ground, and (typically)
      they can only produce forces in certain directions, for instance as
      described by a "friction cone" (you can push on the ground but not pull
      on the ground, and with Coulomb friction the forces tangential to the
      ground must be smaller than the forces normal to the ground, as described
      by a coefficient of friction, e.g. $f^{B_i}_{i,C_z} \ge 0, |f^{B_i}_{i,C_x}|
      < \mu f^{B_i}_{i,C_z}$) where $C$ is the <a
      href="multibody.html#contact">contact frame</a>.</p>

      <figure><img width="50%" src="figures/hovercraftLegs.svg"/></figure>

      <p>The constraints on where you can put your feet / thrusters will depend on the
      kinematics of your leg, and the speed at which you can move them will depend on
      the full dynamics of the leg -- these are difficult constraints to deal with.  But
      the actual dynamics of the rigid body, $B$, are actually still just the spacecraft
      dynamics, and are still simple!</p>

  <section><h1>Center of pressure (CoP) and Zero-moment point (ZMP)</h1>
  
    <subsection><h1>The special case of flat terrain</h1>

      <p>While not the only important case, it is extremely common for our robots
      to be walking over flat, or nearly flat terrain.  In this situation, even if
      the robot is touching the ground in a number of places (e.g., two heels and
      two toes), the constraints on the center of mass dynamics can be summarized
      very efficiently.</p>

      <figure>
        <img width="80%" src="figures/flat_terrain.svg"/>
        <figcaption>External forces acting on a robot pushing on a flat ground</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>First, on flat terrain $f^{B_i}_{i,W_z}$ represents the normal component of the
      force contact point $i$.  If we assume that the robot can only push on the ground
      (and not pull), then this implies $$\forall i, f^{B_i}_{i,W_z} \ge 0 \Rightarrow
      \sum_i f^{B_i}_{i,W_z} \ge 0 \Rightarrow \ddot{z} \ge -g.$$  In
      other words, if I cannot pull on the ground, then my center of mass cannot
      accelerate towards the ground faster than gravity.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, if we use a Coulomb model of friction on the ground, with
      friction coefficient $\mu$, then $$\forall i, |f^{B_i}_{i,W_x}| \le \mu
      f^{B_i}_{i,W_z} \Rightarrow \sum_i |f^{B_i}_{i,W_x}| \le \mu \sum_i
      f^{B_i}_{i,W_z} \Rightarrow |\ddot{x}| \le \mu (\ddot{z} + g).$$  For
      instance, if I keep my center of mass height at a constant velocity, then
      $\ddot{z}=0$ and $|\ddot{x}| \le \mu g$; this is a nice reminder of just
      how important friction is if you want to be able to move around in the
      world.</p>

      <p>Even better, let us define the "center of pressure" (CoP) as the point on the
      ground where $$\begin{bmatrix} x_{cp} \\ z_{cp}\end{bmatrix} \equiv
      \,{}^Wp^{R_{cp}}_W = \frac{\sum_i {}^Wp^{B_i}_{W}\, f^{B_i}_{W_z}}{\sum_i
      f^{B_i}_{W_z}}.$$ Since all ${}^Wp^{B_i}_{W_z}$ are equal on flat terrain,
      $z_{cp}$ is just the height of the terrain.  It turns out that the center of
      pressure is a "zero-moment point" (ZMP) -- a property that we will demonstrate
      below -- and a moment-balance equation (see below) gives us a very important
      relationship between the location of the CoP and the dynamics of the CoM:
      \begin{equation} (m\ddot{z} + mg) (x_{cp} - x) = (z_{cp} - z) m\ddot{x} -
      I\ddot\theta. \label{eq:cop} \end{equation} If $\ddot{z} = \ddot{\theta} = 0$, or
      more generally if the rate of change in vertical and angular momentum about the
      center of mass is small, then the result is the famous "ZMP equations":
      \begin{equation} \ddot{x} = g \frac{(x - x_{cp})}{(z - z_{cp})}. \label{eq:zmp}
      \end{equation} So the location of the center of pressure completely determines the
      acceleration of the center of mass, and vice versa!  What's more, when $z -
      z_{cp}$ is a constant (the center of mass remains at a constant height relative to
      the ground) or following a predetermined schedule, the remaining relationship is
      affine -- a property that we can exploit in a number of ways.</p>

      <p> As an example, we can easily relate constraints on the CoP to
      constraints on $\ddot{x}$. It is easy to verify from the definition that
      the CoP must live inside the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of the
      ground contact points.  Therefore, if we use the $\ddot{z}=\ddot\theta=0$
      strategy, then this directly implies strict bounds on the possible
      accelerations of the center of mass given the locations of the ground
      contacts.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>An aside: Zero-moment point derivation</h1>

      <p>The zero-moment point (ZMP) is discussed very frequently in the current
      literature on legged robots.  It also has an unfortunate tendency to be
      surrounded by some confusion; a number of people have defined the ZMP is
      slightly different ways (see e.g. <elib>Goswami99</elib> for a summary).
      Therefore, it makes sense to provide a simple derivation here.</p>

      <p>First let us recall that for rigid body systems I can always summarize
      the contributions from many external forces as a single <i>wrench</i>
      (force and torque) on the object -- this is simply because the $F_i$ terms
      enter our equations of motion linearly.  Specifically, the position $p^A$ of an arbitrary point $A$:</p> <figure><img
      width="50%" src="figures/zmp_derivation.svg"/></figure> 

      <p>I can re-write the equations of motion as \begin{align*} m\ddot{x} =&
      \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_x} = f^A_{net,W_x},\\ m\ddot{z} =& \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_z}
      - mg = f^A_{net,W_z} - mg,\\ I\ddot\theta =& \sum_i \left[ {}^Bp^{B_i}_W
      \times f^{B_i}_W \right]_y = [{}^Bp^A_W \times f^A_{net,W}]_y +
      \tau^A_{net,W}, \end{align*} where $f^A_{net} = \sum_i f^{B_i}$ and the
      value of $\tau^A_{net}$ depends on the position, $p^A$. For some choices
      of $p^A$, we can make $\tau^A_{net}=0$. We'll call these points
      $\text{ZMP}$, for which we have \begin{equation} \left[
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_W \times f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W} \right]_y =
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W_x} -
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_x} f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W_z} = \sum_i \left[
      {}^Bp^{B_i}_W \times f^{B_i}_W \right]_y. \label{eq:zmp_def}
      \end{equation} We can see that whenever we have ground reaction forces
      ($f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W_z} \ne 0$) there is an entire line of solutions,
      ${}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_x} = a\, {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} + b$, including
      one that will intercept the terrain.  For walking robots, it is this
      point on the ground from which the external wrench can be described by a
      single force vector (and no moment) that is the famous "zero-moment
      point" (ZMP).</p>

      <definition id="zmp_def"><h1>Zero-moment point (ZMP)</h1>
      <p>The total contribution of external forces on our robot can always be summarized as
      a single <a
      href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/clutter.html#spatial_force">spatial
      force</a> applied at any point $P$. We call $P$ a "zero-moment point" if at $P$,
      the rotational component of the total spatial force (e.g. the torque or moment) is
      zero.</p>

      <p>For walking on flat terrain, by convection we denote "the ZMP" as the unique
      zero-moment point on the terrain.</p>
      </definition>

      <p>We can rewrite the equations of motion in terms of the ZMP.
      Substituting the equations of motion into equation \ref{eq:zmp_def},
      to replace the individual terms of $f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net}$, we have \[
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} m\ddot{x} - {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_x}
      (m\ddot{z} + mg) = I \ddot{\theta}. \] But this is precisely the
      equation \ref{eq:cop} presented above.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, since \[\sum_i \left[ {}^Bp^{B_i}_W \times f^{B_i}_W
      \right]_y = \sum_i \left( {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_z} f^{B_i}_{W_x} -
      {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_x} f^{B_i}_{W_z} \right), \] and for <i>flat terrain</i>
      we have \[ \sum_i {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_z} f^{B_i}_{W_x} =
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_x} = {}^Bp^\text{ZMP}_{W_z}
      f^\text{ZMP}_{net, W_x}, \] then we can see that this ZMP is exactly the
      CoP: \[ {}^Bp^\text{ZMP}_{W_x} = \frac{\sum_i {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_x}
      f^{B_i}_{W_z}}{\sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_z} }. \] </p>

      <p>In three dimensions, we solve for the point on the ground where
      $\tau^\text{ZMP}_{net,W_y} = \tau^\text{ZMP}_{net,W_x} = 0$, but allow $\tau^\text{ZMP}_{net,W_z} \ne 0$ to
      extract the analogous equations in the $y$-axis:  \[
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} m\ddot{y} - {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_y} (m\ddot{z}
      + mg) = I \ddot{\theta}. \] </p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>A note about impact dynamics</h1>

      <p>In the previous chapter we devoted relatively a lot of attention to
      dynamics of impact, characterized for instance by a guard that resets
      dynamics in a hybrid dynamical system.  In those models we used impulsive
      ground-reaction forces (these forces are instantaneously infinite, but
      doing finite work) in order to explain the discontinuous change in
      velocity required to avoid penetration with the ground.  This story can be
      extended naturally to the dynamics of the center of mass.<p>

      <p>For an articulated robot, though, there are a number of possible
      strategies for the legs which can affect the dynamics of the center of
      mass.  For example, if the robot hits the ground with a stiff leg like the
      rimless wheel, then the angular momentum about the point of collision will
      be conserved, but any momentum going into the ground will be lost.
      However, if the robot has a spring leg and a massless toe like the SLIP
      model, then no energy need be lost.</p>

      <p>One strategy that many highly-articulated legged robots use is to keep the
      vertical component of their <i>center of mass</i> at a constant velocity,
      $$\dot{z} = c \quad \Rightarrow \quad \ddot{z} = 0,$$  and minimize their angular
      momentum about the center of mass (here $I\dot\theta=0 \Rightarrow I\ddot\theta =
      0$).  Using this strategy, if the swinging foot lands roughly below the center of
      mass, then even with a stiff leg there is no energy dissipated in the collision -
      all of the momentum is conserved.  This the common approach/justification for most
      of the humanoid literature ignoring the impact dynamics when reasoning about the
      centroidal dynamics.</p>

    </subsection>
  </section>

  <section><h1>ZMP-based planning</h1>

    <p>Understanding the relationship between the center of pressure and the
    center of mass motion gives us a number of important tools for planning
    motions of our complex robots. I'll describe one of the most common
    pipeline for planning these motions, which decomposes the problem into:
    <ol>
      <li>planning the footstep (or more generally the contact) positions, then</li>
      <li>planning the motion of the center of mass, and finally</li>
      <li>calculating the individual joint motions to realize the desired
      center of mass and footstep trajectories</li>
    </ol>
    This pipeline started with the famous ZMP walkers (like Honda's ASIMO),
    with a focus on walking on flat terrain, but many of the concepts
    generalize naturally to 3D and more general robot motion.</p>
    
    <p>Most notable here is the decision to separate the complicated planning
    problem into a sequence of simpler planning problems. Of course, one pays
    some price for the decomposition -- footstep plans tend to be conservative
    and kinematic because they do not reason directly about the dynamics of the
    robot. And the centroidal planning cannot accurately account for
    joint-level constraints, such as joint-position limits or effort limits.
    But these approximations enable dramatically simpler planning solutions.
    </p>

        the center of mass position and velocity) in addition to the nominal plan.</p>
      </example>

  <section><h1>Centroidal dynamics</h1>

    <p>It turns out the specific equations that we used in our thought experiment and
    ZMP derivation aren't restricted to a single body and massless legs. Although the
    equations of motion for a full humanoid are indeed complicated, if we write the
    equations of motion <i>of the center of mass</i>, then those dynamics are
    essentially the same as the single body case we've derived above.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Spatial momentum</h1>
    
      <p>Let's generalize our notation for a single rigid body a bit more before we make
      things more complex.</p>

      <p>In the simple model above, we chose to use the generalized positions $\bq =
      [\theta, x, z]$, where $x$ and $z$ were taken to be the position of the center of
      mass, ${}^Wp^{B_{cm}}$. Let's observe that this particular choice of generalized
      velocity actually corresponds to an important physical quantity -- the <a
      href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#jacobian">spatial velocity</a>
      (the concatenation of the angular velocity and the translational velocity). Using
      the full monogram notation, we can write the spatial velocity of the center of
      mass of body B, relative to the world frame, as $${}^WV^{B_{cm}} = \begin{bmatrix}
      {}^W\dot\theta^B \\ {}^W\dot{p}^{B_{cm}} \end{bmatrix}.$$  We can similarly define
      a <a href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/clutter.html#spatial_force">spatial
      force</a>, $F^{B_{cm}}_i$, by concatenating the moment and forces, and <i>spatial
      inertia</i> of the body taken around the center of mass: $$M^{B/B_{cm}} =
      \begin{bmatrix} I & 0 & 0\\ 0 & m & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & m \end{bmatrix},$$ and the
      <i>spatial momentum</i> vector (the concatenation of angular momentum +
      linear/translational momentum) as $${}^W L^{B/B_{cm}}(\dot\bq) = \begin{bmatrix} I
      \dot\theta \\ m \dot{x} \\ m \dot{z} \end{bmatrix} = M^{B/B_{cm}}
      {}^WV^{B_{cm}}.$$ Now recognize that the left-hand side of equations
      (\ref{eq:spacecraft_x}-\ref{eq:spacecraft_theta}) can be written simply as
      \begin{equation}{}^W\dot{L}^{B/B_{cm}}(\ddot\bq) = \sum_i
      F^{B_{cm}}_i,\label{eq:Ldot}\end{equation} the rate of change of the spatial
      momentum is just the sum of the spatial forces applied applied at $B_{cm}$.</p>
    
    </subsection>    

    <subsection><h1>Generalization to multibody</h1>

      <p>We can write the <i>configuration-dependent</i> center of mass of the entire
      robot, $R,$ as the (weighted) sum of the center of masses of the individual links:
      $$\begin{bmatrix} x_{cm} \\ z_{cm} \end{bmatrix} \equiv {}^Wp^{R_{cm}}(\bq) = \frac{\sum_i {}^W p^{B_{i,cm}}(\bq) \, m_i}{\sum_i m_i} =
      \frac{\sum_i {}^WX^{B_i}(\bq) \,{}^B_i p^{B_{i,cm}} \, m_i}{\sum_i m_i}.$$</p>

      <p>One can define the spatial momentum of the entire robot, $R,$ about this point.
      It is now configuration dependent, but takes a particularly simple form: $${}^W
      L^{R/R_{cm}}(\bq, \dot\bq) = {\bf A}(\bq)\dot\bq,$$ it can be computed in Drake for
      a <code>MultibodyPlant</code> using the
      <code>CalcSpatialMomentumInWorldAboutPoint()</code> method. The matrix ${\bf
      A}(\bq)$ is known as the centroidal momentum matrix<elib>Orin13</elib>. The rate of
      change of this whole-body spatial momentum is still given by the sum of the forces
      (once the spatial tranforms are properly applied):
      \begin{equation}{}^W\dot{L}^{R/R_{cm}}(\bq, \dot\bq, \ddot\bq) = {\bf
      A}(\bq)\ddot{\bq} + \dot{\bf A}(\bq, \dot\bq)\dot\bq = \sum_i
      F^{B_{cm}}_i.\label{eq:centroidal} \end{equation}</p>

      <p>I suspect you already know this intuitively. Imagine you are an astronaut
      experiencing (effectively) zero-gravity. If you are not applying external forces,
      then your center of mass acceleration will be zero, and your total angular momentum
      will be conserved. Equation (\ref{eq:centroidal}) simply generalizes to the case
      where forces are still applied.</p>

      <p>Let me make one important point very clear: <b>this is not an
      approximation</b>. This equations exactly describe the motion of the center of
      mass (and angular momentum about the center of mass). The simplification here is
      not because we are approximating the dynamics, but rather because we have not yet
      captured all of the constraints we might need to put on the forces we can produce
      with our limbs (due to kinematic constraints) and our actuators (due to e.g.
      torque limits).</p>

      Consider an abstracted legged robot.
      The foot (enclosed by points HTP) and the leg of length $l$ are assumed to be massless.
      The point mass $m$ at the end of the leg represents the robot's body.
      The foot and the leg are connected via a pin joint at P.
      For parts (a,b,c,d), assume that there is no actuator at the pin joint P.
    <ol type = "a">
      <li> 
        Please draw separate free body diagrams for the bob, the leg, and the foot. 
        For the foot, assume that the ground reaction forces are only applied at the heel and at the toe.

      <li> 
          Is the system stable at $\theta = \pi/2 + 10^{-3}$?

      <li>
        For the rest of this problem, assume that there is an actuator at the ankle with a controller that perfectly cancels out the gravitational torque due to the bob around $P$, so that $\ddot{\theta} = 0$. 
        Suppose that the robot is about to fall down.
        What can you say about the ground reaction forces at the heel and at the toe?

        What range of values of $\theta$ can you achieve without falling down? 
        Express your answer in terms of the constants $m, h, l, L_{1}, L_{2}$ (as needed).

      <li>
        Suppose you are designing a (massless) foot that maximizes the range of postures that the robot can assume without falling down. 
        Suppose we can apply a torque at the ankle without torque limits.<ol type = i>
          <li>
            Would you want a taller or a flatter foot (bigger or smaller $h$)?

          <li>
            Would you want a longer or a shorter foot (bigger or smaller $L_1 + L_2$)?

          <li>
            Where would you put the ankle with respect to the heel and toe?

      </li>

      <li>
        Suppose you are designing a (massless) foot for a robot that will only walk forward.
        You thus wish to make it easier for the robot's heel to lift off the ground.
        Suppose we can apply a torque at the ankle without torque limits.

    <exercise id="GCS_footstep_planning"><h1>Footstep Planning via Graph of

      <p>In this exercise we implement a simplified version of the footstep
      planning problem formulated as a shortest path problem (SPP) in GCS
      (proposed in <elib>Marcucci21</elib>). Compared to the MIQP formulation
      seen in <a href="humanoids.html#MIQP_footstep_planning">this
      exercise</a>, the convex relaxation problem using GCS reduces to a linear
      program (LP) -- it is much more computationally efficient and
      consequently scales better. You will find all the
      details in <script>document.write(notebook_link('humanoids', 'footstep_planning_gcs', link_text='this python notebook'))</script>.
      Your goal is to code most of the components that transcribe the planning

      <ol type="a">

        <li>Construct vertices of the GCS based on the stepping stones.</li>

        <li>Construct valid edges of the GCS between vertices.</li>

        <li>Add constraints associated with each edge that reflect the
        kinematic constraints of the robot.</li>

        <li>Add edge costs that reflect the optimization objective: minimizes
        the total number of steps.</li>
