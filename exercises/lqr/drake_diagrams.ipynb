    "The goal of this exercise is teach you a little more about using Drake to model and analyze systems.  Towards the end of [this Drake tutorial](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/%2Fdynamical_systems.ipynb), you learned a little about how to assemble a Diagram and then run a simple simulation.  In this problem, you'll make a Diagram, and then design an LQR controller for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate this, let's say we already have a System which represents our mathematical model of some mechanical system. We'll use the double integrator here, but more commonly we could use the physics engine in Drake's [`MultibodyPlant`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_multibody_plant.html). These systems assume that our input is a perfect force/torque source. In practice, though, actuators like electric motors aren't perfect torque sources. In particular, they would struggle to produce the instantaneous changes in torque demanded from a bang-bang optimal controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can capture this challenge by writing a second system that models the dynamics of the actuator. It's useful to write this as a different system, because if you write a really nice actuator model, then you can connect it to many different mechanical systems. This is how we do abstraction and write modular code for dynamical systems. Drake has a [growing library of models](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__systems.html) like this which can be assembled into complex Diagrams."
