<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 4"><h1>Highly-articulated Legged
Robots</h1>

  <p>The passive dynamic walkers and hopping robots described in the last
  chapter capture the fundamental dynamics of legged locomotion -- dynamics
  which are fundamentally nonlinear and punctuated by impulsive events due to
  making and breaking contact with the environment.  But if you start reading
  the literature on humanoid robots, or many-legged robots like quadrupeds, then
  you will find a quite different set of ideas taking center stage: ideas like
  the "zero-moment point" and footstep planning.  The goal of this chapter is to
  penetrate that world.</p>

  <p>I'd like to start the discussion with a model that might seem quite far
  from the world of legged robots, but I think it's a very useful way to think
  about the problem.</p>

  <section><h1>Center of Mass Dynamics</h1>

    <subsection><h1>A hovercraft model</h1>

      <figure><img width="70%" src="figures/hovercraft.svg"/></figure>
      <todo>flip the directions of the force vector in the image</todo>

      <p>Imagine you have a flying vehicle modeled as a single rigid body in a
      gravity field with some number of force "thrusters" attached.  We'll
      describe the configuration of the vehicle by its orientation, $\theta$ and
      the location of its center of mass $(x,z)$.  The vector from the center of
      mass to thruster $i$ is given by $r_i$, yielding the equations of motion:
      \begin{align*} m\ddot{x} =& \sum_i F_{i,x},\\ m\ddot{z} =& \sum_i F_{i,z}
      - mg,\\ I\ddot\theta =& \sum_i \left[ r_i \times F_i \right]_y,
      \end{align*} where I've used $F_{i,x}$ to represent the component of the
      force in the $x$ direction and have taken just the $y$-axis component of
      the cross product on the last line. </p>

      <p>Our goal is to move the hovercraft to a desired position/orientation
      and to keep it there.  If we take the inputs to be $F_i$, then the
      dynamics are affine (linear plus a constant term).  As such, we can
      stabilize a stabilizable fixed point using a change of coordinates plus
      LQR or even plan/track a desired trajectory using time-varying LQR.  If I
      were to add additional linear constraints, for instance constraining
      $F_{min} \le F_i \le F_{max}$, then I can still use linear
      model-predictive control (MPC) to plan and stabilize a desired motion. By
      most accounts, this is a relatively easy control problem. (Note that it
      would be considerably harder if my control input or input constraints
      depend on the orientation, $\theta$, but we don't need that here yet).</p>

      <p>Now imagine that you just a small number of thrusters (let's say two)
      each with severe input constraints.  To make things more interesting, let
      us say that you're allowed to move the thrusters, so $\dot{r}_i$ becomes
      an additional control input, but with some important limitations:  you
      have to turn the thrusters off when they are moving (e.g.
      $|F_i||\dot{r}_i| = 0$) and there is a limit to how quickly you can move
      the thrusters $|\dot{r}|_i \le v_{max}$.  This problem is now a lot more
      difficult, due especially to the fact that constraints of the form $u_1
      u_2 = 0$ are non-convex.</p> <center><img width="25%"
      src="figures/complementarityConstraint.svg"/></center> <p>I find this
      a very useful thought exercise; somehow our controller needs to make an
      effectively discrete decision to turn off a thruster and move it.  The
      framework of optimal control should support this - you are sacrificing a
      short-term loss of control authority for the long-term benefit of having
      the thruster positioned where you would like, but we haven't developed
      tools yet that deal well with this discrete plus continuous decision
      making.  We'll need to address that here.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, although the problem is already difficult, we need to
      continue to add constraints.  Now let's say additionally, that the
      thrusters can only be turned on in certain locations, as cartooned
      here:</p> <center><img width="60%"
      src="figures/hovercraftCartesianConstraints.svg"/></center> <p>The
      union of these regions need not form a convex set.  Furthermore, these
      locations could be specified in the robot frame, but may also be specified
      in the world frame, which I'll call ${\bf p}_i$: $${\bf p}_i = {\bf r}_i -
      \begin{bmatrix} x \\ 0 \\ z \end{bmatrix}.$$  This problem still feels
      like it should be tractable, but it's definitely getting hard.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Robots with (massless) legs</h1>

      <p>In my view, the hovercraft problem above is a central component of the
      walking problem.  If we consider a walking robot with massless legs, then
      the feet are exactly like movable thrusters.  As above, they are highly
      constrained - they can only produce force when they are touching the
      ground, and (typically) they can only produce forces in certain
      directions, for instance as described by a "friction cone" (you can push
      on the ground but not pull on the ground, and with Coulomb friction the
      forces tangential to the ground must be smaller than the forces normal to
      the ground, as described by a coefficient of friction, e.g.
      $|F_{\parallel}| < \mu |F_{\perp}|$).</p>

      <figure><img width="50%" src="figures/hovercraftLegs.svg"/></figure>

      <p>The constraints on where you can put your feet / thrusters will depend
      on the kinematics of your leg, and the speed at which you can move them
      will depend on the full dynamics of the leg -- these are difficult
      constraints to deal with.  But the actual dynamics of the rigid body are
      actually still affine, and still simple!</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Capturing the full robot dynamics</h1>

      <p>We don't actually need to have massless legs for this discussion to
      make sense. If we use the coordinates $x,z$ to describe the location of
      the center of mass (CoM) of the entire robot, and $m$ to represent the
      entire mass of the robot, then the first two equations remain unchanged.
      The center of mass is a configuration dependent point, and does not have
      an orientation, but one important generalization of the orientation
      dynamics is given by the centroidal momentum matrix, $A(\bq)$, where
      $A(\bq)\dot{\bq}$ captures the linear and angular momentum of the robot
      around the center of mass <elib>Orin13</elib>. Note that the center of
      mass dynamics are still affine -- even for a big complicated humanoid --
      but the centroidal momentum dynamics are nonlinear.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Impact dynamics</h1>

      <p>In the previous chapter we devoted relatively a lot of attention to
      dynamics of impact, characterized for instance by a guard that resets
      dynamics in a hybrid dynamical system.  In those models we used impulsive
      ground-reaction forces (these forces are instantaneously infinite, but
      doing finite work) in order to explain the discontinuous change in
      velocity required to avoid penetration with the ground.  This story can be
      extended naturally to the dynamics of the center of mass.<p>

      <p>For an articulated robot, though, there are a number of possible
      strategies for the legs which can affect the dynamics of the center of
      mass.  For example, if the robot hits the ground with a stiff leg like the
      rimless wheel, then the angular momentum about the point of collision will
      be conserved, but any momentum going into the ground will be lost.
      However, if the robot has a spring leg and a massless toe like the SLIP
      model, then no energy need be lost.</p>

      <p>One strategy that many highly-articulated legged robots use is to keep
      their center of mass at a constant height, $$z = c \quad \Rightarrow \quad
      \dot{z} = \ddot{z} = 0,$$  and minimize their angular momentum about the
      center of mass (here $\ddot\theta=0$).  Using this strategy, if the
      swinging foot lands roughly below the center of mass, then even with a
      stiff leg there is no energy dissipated in the collision - all of the
      momentum is conserved.  This often (but does not always) justify ignoring
      the impacts in the center of mass dynamics of the system.</p>

    </subsection>

  </section> <!-- end COM dynamics -->

  <section><h1>The special case of flat terrain</h1>

    <p>While not the only important case, it is extremely common for our robots
    to be walking over flat, or nearly flat terrain.  In this situation, even if
    the robot is touching the ground in a number of places (e.g., two heels and
    two toes), the constraints on the center of mass dynamics can be summarized
    very efficiently.</p>

    <figure>
      <img width="80%" src="figures/flat_terrain.svg"/>
      <figcaption>External forces acting on a robot pushing on a flat ground</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>First, on flat terrain $F_{i,z}$ represents the force that is normal to
    the surface at contact point $i$.  If we assume that the robot can only push
    on the ground (and not pull), then this implies $$\forall i, F_{i,z} \ge 0
    \Rightarrow \sum_i F_{i,z} \ge 0 \Rightarrow \ddot{z} \ge -g.$$  In other
    words, if I cannot pull on the ground, then my center of mass cannot
    accelerate towards the ground faster than gravity.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, if we use a Coulomb model of friction on the ground, with
    friction coefficient $\mu$, then $$\forall i, |F_{i,x}| \le \mu F_{i,z}
    \Rightarrow \sum_i |F_{i,x}| \le \mu \sum_i F_z \Rightarrow |\ddot{x}| \le
    \mu (\ddot{z} + g).$$  For instance, if I keep my center of mass at a
    constant height, then $\ddot{z}=0$ and $|\ddot{x}| \le \mu g$; this is a
    nice reminder of just how important friction is if you want to be able to
    move around in the world.</p>

    <p>Even better, let us define the "center of pressure" (CoP) as the point on
    the ground where $$x_{cop} = \frac{\sum_i p_{i,x} F_{i,z}}{\sum_i
    F_{i,z}},$$ and since all $p_{i,z}$ are equal on flat terrain, $z_{cop}$ is
    just the height of the terrain.  It turns out that the center of pressure is
    a "zero-moment point" (ZMP) -- a property that we will demonstrate below --
    and moment-balance equation gives us a very important relationship between
    the location of the CoP and the dynamics of the CoM: \[ (m\ddot{z} + mg)
    (x_{cop} - x) = (z_{cop} - z) m\ddot{x} - I\ddot\theta. \]  If we use the
    strategy proposed above for ignoring collision dynamics, $\ddot{z} =
    \ddot{\theta} = 0$, then we have $z - z_{cop}$ is a constant height $h$, and
    the result is the famous "ZMP equations": \[ \ddot{x} = -\frac{g}{h}
    (x_{cop}-x). \]  So the location of the center of pressure completely
    determines the acceleration of the center of mass, and vice versa!  What's
    more, this relationship is affine -- a property that we can exploit in a
    number of ways.  </p>

    <p> As an example, we can easily relate constraints on the CoP to
    constraints on $\ddot{x}$. It is easy to verify from the definition that the
    CoP must live inside the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of the
    ground contact points.  Therefore, if we use the $\ddot{z}=\ddot\theta=0$
    strategy, then this directly implies strict bounds on the possible
    accelerations of the center of mass given the locations of the ground
    contacts.</p>

    <subsection><h1>An aside: the zero-moment point
    derivation</h1>

      <p>The zero-moment point (ZMP) is discussed very frequently in the current
      literature on legged robots.  It also has an unfortunate tendency to be
      surrounded by some confusion; a number of people have defined the ZMP is
      slightly different ways (see e.g. <elib>Goswami99</elib> for a summary).
      Therefore, it makes sense to provide a simple derivation here.</p>

      <p>First let us recall that for rigid body systems I can always summarize
      the contributions from many external forces as a single <i>wrench</i>
      (force and torque) on the object -- this is simply because the $F_i$ terms
      enter our equations of motion linearly.  Specifically, given any point in
      space, $r$, in coordinates relative to $(x,z)$:</p> <figure><img
      width="70%" src="figures/zmp_derivation.svg"/></figure> <todo>update
      diagram to have r instead of p</todo>

      <p>I can re-write the equations of motion as \begin{align*} m\ddot{x} =&
      \sum_i F_{i,x} = F_{net,x},\\ m\ddot{z} =& \sum_i F_{i,z} - mg = F_{net,z}
      - mg,\\ I\ddot\theta =& \sum_i \left[ r_i \times F_i \right]_y = ({\bf r}
      \times {\bf F}_{net})_y + \tau_{net}, \end{align*} where ${\bf F}_{net} =
      \sum_i {\bf F}_i$ and the value of $\tau_{net}$ depends on the location
      ${\bf r}$.  For some choices of ${\bf r}$, we can make $\tau_{net}=0$.
      Examining \[ ({\bf r} \times {\bf F}_{net})_y = r_z F_{net,x} - r_x
      F_{net,z} = \left[ r_i \times F_i \right]_y, \] we can see that when
      $F_{net,z} > 0$ there is an entire line of solutions, $r_x = a r_z + b$,
      including one that will intercept the terrain.  For walking robots, it is
      this point on the ground from which the external wrench can be described
      by a single force vector (and no moment) that is the famous "zero-moment
      point" (ZMP).     Substituting the back in to replace $F_{net}$, we can
      see that \[ r_x = \frac{r_z m \ddot{x} - I \ddot\theta}{m\ddot{z} + mg}.
      \] If we assume that $\ddot{z}=\ddot{\theta}=0$ and replace the relative
      coordinates with the global coordinates ${\bf r} = {\bf p} - [x,0,z]^T$,
      then we arrive at precisely the equation presented above.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, since \[\left[ r_i \times F_i \right]_y = \sum_i \left(
      r_{i,z} F_{i,x} - r_{i,x} F_{i,z} \right), \] and for <i>flat terrain</i>
      we have \[ r_z F_{net,x} = \sum_i r_{i,z} F_{i,x}, \] then we can see that
      this ZMP is exactly the CoP: \[ r_x = \frac{\sum_i r_{i,x} F_{i,z}}{
      F_{net,z} }. \] </p>

      <p>In three dimensions, we solve for the point on the ground where
      $\tau_{net,y} = \tau_{net,x} = 0$, but allow $\tau_{net,z} \ne 0$ to
      extract the analogous equations in the $y$-axis:  \[ r_y = \frac{r_z m
      \ddot{y} - I \ddot\theta}{m\ddot{z} + mg}. \] </p>
