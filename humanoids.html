<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 4"><h1>Highly-articulated Legged
Robots</h1>

  <p>The passive dynamic walkers and hopping robots described in the last
  chapter capture the fundamental dynamics of legged locomotion -- dynamics
  which are fundamentally nonlinear and punctuated by impulsive events due to
  making and breaking contact with the environment.  But if you start reading
  the literature on humanoid robots, or many-legged robots like quadrupeds, then
  you will find a quite different set of ideas taking center stage: ideas like
  the "zero-moment point" and footstep planning.  The goal of this chapter is to
  penetrate that world.</p>

  <p>Since our robots are getting more complicated, I'm going to need a bit
  stronger notation. In Drake we use <a
  href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__notation.html">monogram
  notation</a> and define it's spatial algebra <a
  href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#monogram">here for
  kinematics</a>, <a
  href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#jacobian">differential
  kinematics (velocities)</a> and <a
  href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/clutter.html#spatial_force">here for
  force</a>.</p>

  <section><h1>Centroidal dynamics</h1>

    <p>Perhaps one of the most surprising thing about the world of complex
    (highly-articulated) legged robots is the dominant use of simple models for
    estimation, planning, and control.  These abstractions become valuable when
    you have enough degrees of freedom to move your feet independently (to an
    extent) from how you move your body.</p>

    <p>Let's start the discussion with a model that might seem quite far from
    the world of legged robots, but I think it's a very useful way to think
    about the problem.</p>
    
    <subsection><h1>A spacecraft model</h1>

      <figure><img width="70%" src="figures/zmp_thrusters.svg"/></figure>

      <p>Imagine you have a flying vehicle modeled as a single rigid body in a
      gravity field with some number of force "thrusters" attached.  We'll
      describe the pose of the body in the world frame, ${}^WX^B$,
      parameterized by its position $(x,z)$ and orientation $\theta$, and take
      the center of mass to be at the origin of this body frame. The vector
      from the center of mass to thruster $i$ in the world frame is given by
      ${}^Bp^{B_i}_W$, yielding the equations of motion: \begin{align*} m\ddot{x}
      =& \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_x},\\ m\ddot{z} =& \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_z} - mg,\\
      I\ddot\theta =& \sum_i \left[ {}^Bp^{B_i}_W \times f^{B_i}_W \right]_y,
      \end{align*} where I've used $f^{B_i}_{W_x}$ to represent the
      $x$-component of the force applied to $B$ at the location of thruster
      $i$, expressed in the world frame, and we take the $y$-axis component of
      the cross product on the last line.
      </p>

      <p>Our goal is to move the spacecraft to a desired position/orientation
      and to keep it there.  If we take the inputs to be $f^{B_i}_W$, then the
      dynamics are affine (linear plus a constant term).  As such, we can
      stabilize a stabilizable fixed point using a change of coordinates plus
      LQR or even plan/track a desired trajectory using time-varying LQR.  If I
      were to add additional linear constraints, for instance constraining
      $f_{min} \le f^{B_i}_W \le f_{max}$, then I can still use linear
      model-predictive control (MPC) to plan and stabilize a desired motion. By
      most accounts, this is a relatively easy control problem. (Note that it
      would be considerably harder if my control input or input constraints
      depend on the orientation, $\theta$, but we don't need that here yet).</p>

      <p>Now imagine that you have just a small number of thrusters (let's say
      two) each with severe input constraints.  To make things more
      interesting, let us say that you're allowed to move the thrusters, so
      ${}^B\text{v}^{B_i} = \frac{d}{dt} {}^Bp^{B_i}$ becomes an additional
      control input, but with some important limitations:  you have to turn the
      thrusters off when they are moving (e.g. $f^{B_i}{}^B_{W_j}
      \text{v}^{B_i}_{W_j} = 0$) and there is a limit to how quickly you can
      move the thrusters $|{}^B\text{v}^{B_i}_{W_j}| \le \text{v}_{max}$.  This
      problem is now a lot more difficult, due especially to the fact that
      constraints of the form $xy = 0$ are non-convex (the red area in the
      illustration below represents the feasible set).</p>
      <center><img width="25%"
      src="figures/complementarity_constraint.svg"/></center> <p>I find this a
      very useful thought exercise; somehow our controller needs to make an
      effectively discrete decision to turn off a thruster and move it.  The
      framework of optimal control should support this - you are sacrificing a
      short-term loss of control authority for the long-term benefit of having
      the thruster positioned where you would like, but we haven't developed
      tools yet that deal well with this discrete plus continuous decision
      making.  We'll need to address that here.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, although the problem is already difficult, we need a
      few more constraints to make it relevant for legged robots.  Now let's
      say additionally, that the thrusters can only be turned on in certain
      locations, as cartooned here:</p> <center><img width="70%"
      src="figures/zmp_thrusters_w_regions.svg"/></center> <p>Even if the
      individual regions are convex, the union of these regions need not form a
      convex set.  Furthermore, these locations are often expressed in the
      world frame, not the robot frame, e.g. $${\bf A}\, {}^W p^{R_i}_W \le {\bf
      b}.$$</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Robots with (massless) legs</h1>

      <p>In my view, the spacecraft with thrusters problem above is a central
      component of the walking problem.  If we consider a walking robot as our
      single rigid body, $B$, with massless legs, then the feet are exactly
      like movable thrusters.  As above, they are highly constrained - they can
      only produce force when they are touching the ground, and (typically)
      they can only produce forces in certain directions, for instance as
      described by a "friction cone" (you can push on the ground but not pull
      on the ground, and with Coulomb friction the forces tangential to the
      ground must be smaller than the forces normal to the ground, as described
      by a coefficient of friction, e.g. $f^{B_i}_{C_z} \ge 0, |f^{B_i}_{C_x}|
      < \mu f^{B_i}_{C_z}$) where $C$ is the <a
      href="multibody.html#contact">contact frame</a>.</p>

      <figure><img width="50%" src="figures/hovercraftLegs.svg"/></figure>

      <p>The constraints on where you can put your feet / thrusters will depend
      on the kinematics of your leg, and the speed at which you can move them
      will depend on the full dynamics of the leg -- these are difficult
      constraints to deal with.  But the actual dynamics of the rigid body,
      $B$, are actually still affine, and still simple!</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Capturing the full robot dynamics</h1>

      <p>We don't actually need to have massless legs for this discussion to
      make sense. If we use the coordinates $x,z$ to describe the location of
      the center of mass (CoM) of the entire robot, and $m$ to represent the
      entire mass of the robot, then the first two equations remain unchanged.
      The center of mass is a configuration dependent point, and does not have
      an orientation, but one important generalization of the orientation
      dynamics is given by the centroidal momentum matrix, $A(\bq)$, where
      $A(\bq)\dot{\bq}$ captures the linear and angular momentum of the robot
      around the center of mass <elib>Orin13</elib>. Note that the center of
      mass dynamics are still affine -- even for a big complicated humanoid --
      but the centroidal momentum dynamics are nonlinear.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Impact dynamics</h1>

      <p>In the previous chapter we devoted relatively a lot of attention to
      dynamics of impact, characterized for instance by a guard that resets
      dynamics in a hybrid dynamical system.  In those models we used impulsive
      ground-reaction forces (these forces are instantaneously infinite, but
      doing finite work) in order to explain the discontinuous change in
      velocity required to avoid penetration with the ground.  This story can be
      extended naturally to the dynamics of the center of mass.<p>

      <p>For an articulated robot, though, there are a number of possible
      strategies for the legs which can affect the dynamics of the center of
      mass.  For example, if the robot hits the ground with a stiff leg like the
      rimless wheel, then the angular momentum about the point of collision will
      be conserved, but any momentum going into the ground will be lost.
      However, if the robot has a spring leg and a massless toe like the SLIP
      model, then no energy need be lost.</p>

      <p>One strategy that many highly-articulated legged robots use is to keep
      their <i>center of mass</i> at a constant velocity, $$\dot{z} = c \quad
      \Rightarrow \quad \ddot{z} = 0,$$  and minimize their angular momentum
      about the center of mass (here $\ddot\theta=0$).  Using this strategy, if
      the swinging foot lands roughly below the center of mass, then even with
      a stiff leg there is no energy dissipated in the collision - all of the
      momentum is conserved.  This often (but does not always) justify ignoring
      the impacts in the center of mass dynamics of the system.</p>

    </subsection>

  <section><h1>The special case of flat terrain</h1>

    <p>While not the only important case, it is extremely common for our robots
    to be walking over flat, or nearly flat terrain.  In this situation, even if
    the robot is touching the ground in a number of places (e.g., two heels and
    two toes), the constraints on the center of mass dynamics can be summarized
    very efficiently.</p>

    <figure>
      <img width="80%" src="figures/flat_terrain.svg"/>
      <figcaption>External forces acting on a robot pushing on a flat ground</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>First, on flat terrain $f^{B_i}_{W_z}$ represents the force that is
    normal to the surface at contact point $i$.  If we assume that the robot
    can only push on the ground (and not pull), then this implies $$\forall i,
    f^{B_i}_{W_z} \ge 0 \Rightarrow \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_z} \ge 0 \Rightarrow
    \ddot{z} \ge -g.$$  In other words, if I cannot pull on the ground, then my
    center of mass cannot accelerate towards the ground faster than
    gravity.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, if we use a Coulomb model of friction on the ground, with
    friction coefficient $\mu$, then $$\forall i, |f^{B_i}_{W_x}| \le \mu
    f^{B_i}_{W_z} \Rightarrow \sum_i |f^{B_i}_{W_x}| \le \mu \sum_i
    f^{B_i}_{W_z} \Rightarrow |\ddot{x}| \le \mu (\ddot{z} + g).$$  For
    instance, if I keep my center of mass height at a constant velocity, then
    $\ddot{z}=0$ and $|\ddot{x}| \le \mu g$; this is a nice reminder of just
    how important friction is if you want to be able to move around in the
    world.</p>

    <p>Even better, let us define the "center of pressure" (CoP) as the point
    on the ground where $$x_{cop} = \frac{\sum_i {}^Wp^{B_i}_{W_x}
    f^{B_i}_{W_z}}{\sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_z}},$$ and since all ${}^Wp^{B_i}_{W_z}$
    are equal on flat terrain, $z_{cop}$ is just the height of the terrain.  It
    turns out that the center of pressure is a "zero-moment point" (ZMP) -- a
    property that we will demonstrate below -- and moment-balance equation
    gives us a very important relationship between the location of the CoP and
    the dynamics of the CoM: \begin{equation} (m\ddot{z} + mg) (x_{cop} - x) =
    (z_{cop} - z) m\ddot{x} - I\ddot\theta. \label{eq:cop} \end{equation}  If
    we use the strategy proposed above for ignoring collision dynamics,
    $\ddot{z} = \ddot{\theta} = 0$, and the result is the famous "ZMP
    equations": \begin{equation} \ddot{x} = g \frac{(x - x_{cop})}{(z -
    z_{cop})}. \label{eq:zmp} \end{equation}  So the location of the center of
    pressure completely determines the acceleration of the center of mass, and
    vice versa!  What's more, when $z - z_{cop}$ is a constant (the center of
    mass remains at a constant height relative to the ground) or following a
    predetermined schedule, the remaining relationship is affine -- a property
    that we can exploit in a number of ways.</p>

    <p> As an example, we can easily relate constraints on the CoP to
    constraints on $\ddot{x}$. It is easy to verify from the definition that
    the CoP must live inside the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> of the
    ground contact points.  Therefore, if we use the $\ddot{z}=\ddot\theta=0$
    strategy, then this directly implies strict bounds on the possible
    accelerations of the center of mass given the locations of the ground
    contacts.</p>

    <subsection><h1>An aside: the zero-moment point
    derivation</h1>

      <p>The zero-moment point (ZMP) is discussed very frequently in the current
      literature on legged robots.  It also has an unfortunate tendency to be
      surrounded by some confusion; a number of people have defined the ZMP is
      slightly different ways (see e.g. <elib>Goswami99</elib> for a summary).
      Therefore, it makes sense to provide a simple derivation here.</p>

      <p>First let us recall that for rigid body systems I can always summarize
      the contributions from many external forces as a single <i>wrench</i>
      (force and torque) on the object -- this is simply because the $F_i$ terms
      enter our equations of motion linearly.  Specifically, the position $p^A$ of an arbitrary point $A$:</p> <figure><img
      width="70%" src="figures/zmp_derivation.svg"/></figure> 

      <p>I can re-write the equations of motion as \begin{align*} m\ddot{x} =&
      \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_x} = f^A_{net,W_x},\\ m\ddot{z} =& \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_z}
      - mg = f^A_{net,W_z} - mg,\\ I\ddot\theta =& \sum_i \left[ {}^Bp^{B_i}_W
      \times f^{B_i}_W \right]_y = [{}^Bp^A_W \times f^A_{net,W}]_y +
      \tau^A_{net,W}, \end{align*} where $f^A_{net} = \sum_i f^{B_i}$ and the
      value of $\tau^A_{net}$ depends on the position, $p^A$. For some choices
      of $p^A$, we can make $\tau^A_{net}=0$. We'll call these points
      $\text{ZMP}$, for which we have \begin{equation} \left[
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_W \times f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W} \right]_y =
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W_x} -
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_x} f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W_z} = \sum_i \left[
      {}^Bp^{B_i}_W \times f^{B_i}_W \right]_y, \label{eq:zmp_def}
      \end{equation} we can see that whenever we have ground reaction forces
      ($f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net,W_z} \ne 0$) there is an entire line of solutions,
      ${}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_x} = a\, {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} + b$, including
      one that will intercept the terrain.  For walking robots, it is this
      point on the ground from which the external wrench can be described by a
      single force vector (and no moment) that is the famous "zero-moment
      point" (ZMP).</p>

      <p>We can rewrite the equations of motion in terms of the ZMP. Substiting
      the equations of motion into equation \ref{eq:zmp_def},  to replace the
      individual terms of $f^{\text{ZMP}}_{net}$, we have \[
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} m\ddot{x} - {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_x} (m\ddot{z}
      + mg) = I \ddot{\theta}. \] But this is precisely the equation
      \ref{eq:cop} presented above.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, since \[\sum_i \left[ {}^Bp^{B_i}_W \times f^{B_i}_W
      \right]_y = \sum_i \left( {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_z} f^{B_i}_{W_x} -
      {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_x} f^{B_i}_{W_z} \right), \] and for <i>flat terrain</i>
      we have \[ \sum_i {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_z} f^{B_i}_{W_x} =
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} \sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_x} = {}^Bp^\text{ZMP}_{W_z}
      f^\text{ZMP}_{net, W_x}, \] then we can see that this ZMP is exactly the
      CoP: \[ {}^Bp^\text{ZMP}_{W_x} = \frac{\sum_i {}^Bp^{B_i}_{W_x}
      f^{B_i}_{W_z}}{\sum_i f^{B_i}_{W_z} }. \] </p>

      <p>In three dimensions, we solve for the point on the ground where
      $\tau^\text{ZMP}_{net,W_y} = \tau^\text{ZMP}_{net,W_x} = 0$, but allow $\tau^\text{ZMP}_{net,W_z} \ne 0$ to
      extract the analogous equations in the $y$-axis:  \[
      {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_z} m\ddot{y} - {}^Bp^{\text{ZMP}}_{W_y} (m\ddot{z}
      + mg) = I \ddot{\theta}. \] </p>

What value of $\theta$ can you achieve without falling down? Express your answer in terms of the constants $m, h, l, L_{1}, L_{2}$ (if needed).
       </li>

       <li>
         Suppose you are designing a foot that maximizes the postures you can assume without falling down. Suppose we can apply a torque at the ankle without torque limits.<ol type = i>
           <li>
            Would you want a taller or flatter foot?
           </li>
           <li>
             Would you want a longer or shorter foot?
           </li>
           <li>
             Where would you put the ankle with respect to the heel and toe?
           </li>  
         </ol>
       </li>

       <li>
         Suppose you are designing a robot designed to only walk forward. Suppose we can apply a torque at the ankle without torque limits.
          <ol type = i>
           <li>
            Explain the trade offs in foot height.
           </li>
           <li>
            Explain the trade offs in the design of $L_{1}$.
           </li>
           <li>
            Explain the trade offs in the design of $L_{2}$.
