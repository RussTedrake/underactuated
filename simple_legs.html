<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 3"><h1>Simple Models
of Walking and Running</h1>

  <p>Practical legged locomotion is one of the fundamental problems in robotics;
  we've seen amazing progress over the last few years, but there are still some
  fundamental problems.  Much of the recent progress is due to improvements in
  hardware -- a legged robot must carry all of its sensors, actuators and power
  and traditionally this meant underpowered motors that act as far-from-ideal
  force/torque sources -- but Boston Dynamics and other companies have made
  incredible progress here.  The control systems implemented on these systems,
  though, are still surprisingly heuristic -- they require dramatically higher
  bandwidth and lower latency that the human motor control system and still
  perform worse in challenging environments.  I may be biased, but I think a lot
  of the work left to do involves thinking about underactuated control.</p>

  <p>In this chapter we'll introduce some of the simple models of walking and
  robots, the control problems that result, and a very brief summary of some of
  the control solutions described in the literature.  Compared to the robots
  that we have studied so far, our investigations of legged locomotion will
  require additional tools for thinking about limit cycle dynamics and dealing
  with impacts.</p>

  <section><h1>Limit Cycles</h1>

    <p>In many of the systems that we have studied so far, we have analyzed the
    stability of a fixed-point, or even an (infinite-horizon) trajectory.  For
    walking systems the natural equivalent is to talk about the stability of
    periodic solutions -- a fixed "gait" is a cycle that repeats footstep after
    footstep.  So we begin our discussion with a discussion of the stability of
    a cycle.</p>

    <p> A limit cycle is an asymptotically stable or unstable periodic
    orbit&dagger;<sidenote>&dagger; Marginally-stable orbits, such as the
    closed-orbits of the undamped simple pendulum, are typically not called
    limit cycles.</sidenote>.  One of the simplest models of limit cycle
    behavior is the Van der Pol oscillator.  Let's examine that first...</p>

    <example><h1>Van der Pol Oscillator</h1>

      <p>$$\ddot{q} + \mu (q^2 - 1)\dot{q} + q = 0, \quad \mu>0$$ One can think
      of this system as almost a simple spring-mass-damper system, except that
      it has nonlinear damping.  In particular, the velocity term dissipates
      energy when $|q|>1$, and adds energy when $|q|<1$.  Therefore, it is not
      terribly surprising to see that the system settles into a stable
      oscillation from almost any initial conditions (the exception is the state
      $q=0,\dot{q}=0$).  This can be seen nicely in the phase portrait
      below.</p>

      <figure>
        <table width="100%"><tr><td width="50%">
          <img width="100%" src="figures/vanderPol_phase.svg"/>
        </td><td width="50%">

        </td></tr></table>
        <figcaption>System trajectories of the Van der Pol oscillator with $\mu
          =.2$. (Left) phase portrait.  (Right) time domain.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>However, as you can see from the plot of system trajectories in the
      time domain, then a slightly different picture emerges. Although the phase
      portrait clearly reveals that all trajectories converge to the same orbit,
      the time domain plot reveals that these trajectories do not necessarily
      synchronize in time.</p>

    </example> <!-- end of VdP example -->

    <p>The Van der Pol oscillator clearly demonstrates what we would think of as
    a stable limit cycle, but also exposes the subtlety in defining this limit
    cycle stability.  Neighboring trajectories do not necessarily converge on a
    stable limit cycle.  In contrast, defining the stability of a particular
    trajectory (parameterized by time) is relatively easy.</p>

    <p>Let's make a few quick points about the existence of closed-orbits. If we
    can define a closed region of phase space which does not contain any fixed
    points, then it must contain a closed-orbit<elib>Strogatz94</elib>. By
    closed, I mean that any trajectory which enters the region will stay in the
    region (this is the Poincar&eacute-Bendixson Theorem).  It's also
    interesting to note that gradient potential fields (e.g. Lyapunov functions)
    cannot have a closed-orbit<elib>Strogatz94</elib>, and consequently Lyapunov
    analysis cannot be applied to limit cycle stability without some
    modification.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Poincar&eacute; Maps</h1>

      <p> One definition for the stability of a limit cycle uses the method of
      Poincar&eacute.  Let's consider an $n$ dimensional dynamical system,
      $\dot{\bx} = {\bf f}(\bx).$ Define an $n-1$ dimensional <em>surface of
      section</em>, $S$.  We will also require that $S$ is transverse to the
      flow (i.e., all trajectories starting on $S$ flow through $S$, not
      parallel to it).  The Poincar&eacute map (or return map) is a mapping from
      $S$ to itself:  $$\bx_p[n+1] = {\bf P}(\bx_p[n]),$$ where $\bx_p[n]$ is
      the state of the system at the $n$th crossing of the surface of section.
      Note that we will use the notation $\bx_p$ to distinguish the state of the
      discrete-time system from the continuous time system; they are related by
      $\bx_p[n] = \bx(t_c[n])$, where $t_c[n]$ is the time of the $n$th crossing
      of $S$.</p>

      <example><h1>Return map for the Van der Pol Oscillator</h1>

        <p>Since the full system is two dimensional, the return map dynamics are
        one dimensional.  One dimensional maps, like one dimensional flows, are
        amenable to graphical analysis.  To define a Poincar&eacute section for
        the Van der Pol oscillator, let $S$ be the line segment where $q = 0$,
        $\dot{q} > 0$.</p>

        <figure> <table><tr><td> <img width="100%"

        <figcaption>(Left) Phase plot with the surface of section, $S$, drawn
        with a black dashed line.  (Right) The resulting Poincar&eacute
        first-return map (blue), and the line of slope one (red).</figcaption>
        </figure>

      </example>

      <p>If ${\bf P}(\bx_p)$ exists for all $\bx_p \in S$, then this method
      turns the stability analysis for a limit cycle into the stability analysis
      of a fixed point on a discrete map.  In practice it is often difficult or
      impossible to find ${\bf P}$ analytically, but it can be obtained quite
      reasonably numerically.  Once ${\bf P}$ is obtained, we can infer local
      limit cycle stability with an eigenvalue analysis.  There will always be a
      single eigenvalue of 0 - corresponding to perturbations along the limit
      cycle which do not change the state of first return. The limit cycle is
      considered locally exponentially stable if all remaining eigenvalues,
      $\lambda_i$, have magnitude less than one, $|\lambda_i|<1$.</p>

      <p>In fact, it is often possible to infer more global stability properties
      of the return map by examining ${\bf P}$. <elib>Koditschek91</elib>
      describes some of the stability properties known for <em>unimodal</em>
      maps.</p>

      <p>A particularly graphical method for understanding the dynamics of a
      one-dimensional iterated map is with the staircase method.  Sketch the
      Poincar&eacute map and also the line of slope one.  Fixed points are the
      crossings with the unity line.  Asymptotically stable if $|\lambda| < 1$.
      Unlike one dimensional flows, one dimensional maps can have oscillations
      (happens whenever $\lambda < 0$).</p>

  <section><h1>Simple Models of Walking</h1>

    <subsection><h1>The Ballistic Walker</h1>

      <p>One of the earliest models of walking was proposed by
      McMahon<elib>McMahon80</elib>, who argued that humans use a mostly
      ballistic (passive) gait.  COM trajectory looks like a pendulum (roughly
      walking by vaulting).  EMG activity in stance legs is high, but EMG in
      swing leg is very low, except for very beginning and end of swing.
      Proposed a three-link "ballistic walker" model, which models a single
      swing phase (but not transitions to the next swing nor stability).
      Interestingly, in recent years the field has developed a considerably
      deeper appreciation for the role of compliance during walking; simple
      walking-by-vaulting models are starting to fall out of favor.</p>

      <p>McGeer<elib>McGeer90</elib> followed up with a series of walking
      machines, called "passive dynamic walkers".  The walking machine by
      Collins and Ruina<elib>Collins01</elib> is the most impressive passive
      walker to date.</p>

    <subsection><h1>The Rimless Wheel</h1>

      <figure>
      <img width="40%" src="figures/rimlessWheel.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The rimless wheel. The orientation of the stance leg,
      $\theta$, is measured clockwise from the vertical axis. </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The most elementary model of passive dynamic walking, first used in the
      context of walking by <elib>McGeer90</elib>, is the rimless wheel.  This
      simplified system has rigid legs and only a point mass at the hip as
      illustrated in the figure above.  To further simplify the analysis, we
      make the following modeling assumptions:</p> <ul> <li> Collisions with
      ground are inelastic and impulsive (only angular momentum is conserved
      around the point of collision).</li> <li> The stance foot acts as a pin
      joint and does not slip.</li> <li> The transfer of support at the time of
      contact is instantaneous (no double support phase).</li> <li> $0 \le
      \gamma < \frac{\pi}{2}$, $0 < \alpha < \frac{\pi}{2}$, $l > 0$.</li> </ul>
      <p>Note that the coordinate system used here is slightly different than
      for the simple pendulum ($\theta=0$ is at the top, and the sign of
      $\theta$ has changed).</p> <todo> update the coordinates (here and in
      drake)</todo>

      <p> The most comprehensive analysis of the rimless wheel was done by
      <elib>Coleman98a</elib>.</p>

      <subsubsection><h1>Stance Dynamics</h1>

        <p>The dynamics of the system when one leg is on the ground are given by
        $$\ddot\theta = \frac{g}{l}\sin(\theta).$$ If we assume that the system
        is started in a configuration directly after a transfer of support
        ($\theta(0^+) = \gamma-\alpha$), then forward walking occurs when the
        system has an initial velocity, $\dot\theta(0^+) > \omega_1$, where
        $$\omega_1 = \sqrt{ 2 \frac{g}{l} \left[ 1 - \cos \left (\gamma-\alpha
        \right) \right]}.$$ $\omega_1$ is the threshold at which the system has
        enough kinetic energy to vault the mass over the stance leg and take a
        step.  This threshold is zero for $\gamma = \alpha$ and does not exist
        for $\gamma > \alpha$.  The next foot touches down when $\theta(t) =
        \gamma+\alpha$, at which point the conversion of potential energy into
        kinetic energy yields the velocity $$\dot\theta(t^-) = \sqrt{
        \dot\theta^2(0^+) + 4\frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha \sin\gamma }.$$ $t^-$
        denotes the time immediately before the collision.</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Foot Collision</h1>

        <figure> <img width="50%" src="figures/rimlessWheel_collision.svg"/>
        <figcaption>Angular momentum is conserved around the point of
        impact</figcaption> </figure>

        <p> The angular momentum around the point of collision at time $t$ just
        before the next foot collides with the ground is $$L(t^-) =
        -ml^2\dot\theta(t^-) \cos(2\alpha).$$ The angular momentum at the same
        point immediately after the collision is $$L(t^+) =
        -ml^2\dot\theta(t^+).$$ Assuming angular momentum is conserved, this
        collision causes an instantaneous loss of velocity: $$\dot\theta(t^+) =
        \dot\theta(t^-) \cos(2\alpha).$$</p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Forward simulation</h1>

        <p>Given the stance dynamics, the collision detection logic ($\theta =
        \gamma \pm \alpha$), and the collision update, we can numerically
        simulate this simple model.  Doing so reveals something remarkable...
        the wheel starts rolling, but then one of two things happens: it either
        runs out of energy and stands still, or it quickly falls into a stable
        periodic solution.  Convergence to this stable periodic solution appears
        to happen from a huge range of initial conditions.  Try it yourself.</p>

        <example><h1>Numerical simulation of the
        rimless wheel</h1>

          <pysrc>rimless_wheel/simulate.py</pysrc>

          <p>Optionally you can specify the initial conditions.  Here are a few
          good values to try:</p>

          <pysrc args="--initial_angular_velocity=5.0">rimless_wheel/simulate.py</pysrc>
          <pysrc args="--initial_angular_velocity=10.0">rimless_wheel/simulate.py</pysrc>
          <pysrc args="--initial_angular_velocity=0.95">rimless_wheel/simulate.py</pysrc>
          <pysrc args="--initial_angular_velocity=-5.0">rimless_wheel/simulate.py</pysrc>
          <pysrc args="--initial_angular_velocity=-4.8">rimless_wheel/simulate.py</pysrc>

        </example>

        <p>One of the fantastic things about the rimless wheel is that the
        dynamics are exactly the undamped simple pendulum that we've thought so
        much about.  So you will recognize the phase portraits of the system
        below - they are centered around the unstable fixed point of the simple
        pendulum.  Phase plots of the trajectories from the various initial
        conditions recommended above are plotted below.</p>

        <figure>
         <img width="80%" src="figures/rimlessWheel_phase1.svg"/>
         <img width="80%" src="figures/rimlessWheel_phase2.svg"/>

        </figure>

        <p>Take a minute to make sure you can follow these trajectories through
        state space for each of the initial conditions.  It's non-trivial, but
        worth the effort.</p>

      </subsubsection> <!-- end of forward simulation -->

      <subsubsection><h1>Poincar&eacute Map</h1>

        <p>We can now derive the angular velocity at the beginning of each
        stance phase as a function of the angular velocity of the previous
        stance phase. First, we will handle the case where $\gamma \le \alpha$
        and $\dot\theta_n^+ > \omega_1$.  The "step-to-step return map",
        factoring losses from a single collision, the resulting map is:
        $$\dot\theta^{+}_{n+1} = \cos(2\alpha) \sqrt{ ({\dot\theta_n}^{+})^{2} +
        4\frac{g}{l}\sin\alpha \sin\gamma}.$$ where the $\dot{\theta}^{+}$
        indicates the velocity just <em>after</em> the energy loss at impact has
        occurred.</p>

        <p>Using the same analysis for the remaining cases, we can complete the
        return map.  The threshold for taking a step in the opposite direction
        is $$\omega_2 = - \sqrt{2 \frac{g}{l} [1 - \cos(\alpha + \gamma)]}.$$
        For $\omega_2 < \dot\theta_n^{+} < \omega_1,$ we have
        $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = -\dot\theta_n^{+} \cos(2\alpha).$$ Finally, for
        $\dot\theta_n^{+} < \omega_2$, we have $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = -
        \cos(2\alpha)\sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 - 4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha
        \sin\gamma}.$$  Altogether, we have (for $\gamma \le \alpha$)
        $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = \begin{cases} \cos(2\alpha)
        \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 + 4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha \sin\gamma}, &
        \text{ } \omega_1 < \dot\theta_n^{+} \\ -\dot\theta_n^{+} \cos(2\alpha),
        & \text{ } \omega_2 < \dot\theta_n^{+} < \omega_1 \\ -\cos(2\alpha)
        \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 - 4\frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha \sin\gamma}, &
        \dot\theta_n^{+} < w_2 \end{cases}.$$ </p>

        <p>Notice that the return map is undefined for $\dot\theta_n = \{
        \omega_1, \omega_2 \}$, because from these configurations, the wheel
        will end up in the (unstable) equilibrium point where $\theta = 0$ and
        $\dot\theta = 0$, and will therefore never return to the map.</p>

        <p>This return map blends smoothly into the case where $\gamma >
        \alpha$. In this regime, $$\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} = \begin{cases}
        \cos(2\alpha) \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 + 4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha
        \sin\gamma}, & \text{ } 0 \le \dot\theta_n^{+} \\ -\dot\theta_n^{+}
        \cos(2\alpha), & \text{ } \omega_2 < \dot\theta_n^{+} < 0 \\
        -\cos(2\alpha) \sqrt{(\dot\theta_n^{+})^2 - 4\frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha
        \sin\gamma}, & \dot\theta_n^{+} \le w_2 \end{cases}.$$ Notice that the
        formerly undefined points at $\{\omega_1,\omega_2\}$ are now
        well-defined transitions with $\omega_1 = 0$, because it is
        kinematically impossible to have the wheel statically balancing on a
        single leg.</p>

      </subsubsection> <!-- poincare map -->

      <subsubsection><h1>Fixed Points and Stability</h1>

        <p>For a fixed point, we require that $\dot\theta_{n+1}^{+} =
        \dot\theta_n^{+} = \omega^*$.  Our system has two possible fixed points,
        depending on the parameters: $$ \omega_{stand}^* = 0,~~~ \omega_{roll}^*
        = \cot(2 \alpha) \sqrt{4 \frac{g}{l} \sin\alpha\sin\gamma}.$$ The limit
        cycle plotted above illustrates a state-space trajectory in the vicinity
        of the rolling fixed point. $\omega_{stand}^*$ is a fixed point whenever
        $\gamma < \alpha$. $\omega_{roll}^*$ is a fixed point whenever
        $\omega_{roll}^* > \omega_1$.  It is interesting to view these
        bifurcations in terms of $\gamma$.  For small $\gamma$, $\omega_{stand}$
        is the only fixed point, because energy lost from collisions with the
        ground is not compensated for by gravity.  As we increase $\gamma$, we
        obtain a stable rolling solution, where the collisions with the ground
        exactly balance the conversion of gravitational potential to kinetic
        energy. As we increase $\gamma$ further to $\gamma > \alpha$, it becomes
        impossible for the center of mass of the wheel to be inside the support
        polygon, making standing an unstable configuration.</p>

        regions converge to zero velocity ($\omega_{stand}^*$).</figcaption>

    <subsection><h1>The Compass Gait</h1>

      <p>The rimless wheel models only the dynamics of the stance leg, and
      simply assumes that there will always be a swing leg in position at the
      time of collision.  To remove this assumption, we take away all but two of
      the spokes, and place a pin joint at the hip.  To model the dynamics of
      swing, we add point masses to each of the legs.  For actuation, we first
      consider the case where there is a torque source at the hip - resulting in
      swing dynamics equivalent to an Acrobot (although in a different
      coordinate frame).</p>

      <figure>
      <img width="45%" src="figures/compass_gait.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The compass gait</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>In addition to the modeling assumptions used for the rimless wheel, we
      also assume that the swing leg retracts in order to clear the ground
      without disturbing the position of the mass of that leg. This model, known
      as the compass gait, is well studied in the literature using numerical
      methods <elib>Goswami96a+Goswami99+Spong03</elib>, but relatively little
      is known about it analytically.</p>

      <p>The state of this robot can be described by 4 variables:
      $\theta_{st},\theta_{sw},\dot\theta_{st}$, and $\dot\theta_{sw}$. The
      abbreviation $st$ is shorthand for the stance leg and $sw$ for the swing
      leg. Using $\bq = [ \theta_{st}, \theta_{sw} ]^T$ and $\bu = \tau$, we can
      write the dynamics as $$\bM(\bq)\ddot\bq + \bC(\bq,\dot\bq)\dot\bq =
      \btau_g(q) + \bB\bu,$$ with \begin{gather*} \bM = \begin{bmatrix}
      (m_h+m)l^2 + ma^2 & -mlb\cos(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw}) \\
      -mlb\cos(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw}) & mb^2 \end{bmatrix}\\ \bC =
      \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -mlb\sin(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw})\dot\theta_{sw} \\
      mlb\sin(\theta_{st}-\theta_{sw})\dot\theta_{st} & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
      \btau_g(q) = \begin{bmatrix} (m_hl + ma + ml)g\sin(\theta_{st}) \\
      -mbg\sin(\theta_{sw}) \end{bmatrix},\\ \bB = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 1
      \end{bmatrix} \end{gather*} and $l=a+b$.</p>

      <p>The foot collision is an instantaneous change of velocity caused by a
      impulsive force at the foot that brings the foot to rest.  The update to
      the velocities can be calculated using the derivation for impulsive
      collisions derived in the appendix.  To use it, we proceed with the
      following steps:</p>

      <ul> <li>Add a "floating base" to the system by adding a free (x,y) joint
      at the pre-impact stance toe, $\bq_{fb} =
      [x,y,\theta_{st},\theta_{sw}]^T.$</li> <li>Calculate the mass matrix for
      this new system, call it $\bM_{fb}$.</li> <li>Write the position of the
      (pre-impact) swing toe as a function $\bphi(\bq_{fb})$.  Define the
      Jacobian of this function: $\bJ = \frac{\partial \bphi}{\partial
      \bq_{fb}}.$</li> <li>The post-impact velocity that ensures that $\dot\bphi
      = 0$ after the collision is given by $$\dot\bq^+ = \left[ \bI -
      \bM_{fb}^{-1}\bJ^T[\bJ\bM_{fb}^{-1}\bJ^T]^{-1}\bJ\right] \dot\bq^-,$$
      noting that $\dot{x}^- = \dot{y}^- = 0$, and that you need only read out
      the last two elements of $\dot{\bq}^+$.  The velocity of the post-impact
      stance foot will be zero by definition, and the new velocity of the
      pre-impact stance foot can be completely determined from the minimal
      coordinates.</li> <li>Switch the stance and swing leg positions and
      velocities.</li> </ul>

      <example><h1>Numerical simulation of the
        compass gait</h1>

        You can simulate the passive compass gait using:

        <pysrc>compass_gait/simulate.py</pysrc>

      </example>

      <p>Numerical integration of these equations reveals a stable limit cycle,
      plotted below.  Notice that when the left leg is in stance (top part of
      the plot), the trajectory quite resembles the familiar pendulum dynamics
      of the rimless wheel.  But this time, when the leg impacts, it takes a
      long arc around as the swing leg before returning to stance.  The impacts
      are also clearly visible as discontinuous changes (decreases) in velocity.
      The dependence of this limit cycle on the system parameters has been
      studied extensively in <elib>Goswami96a</elib>.</p>

      <figcaption>Passive limit cycle trajectory of the compass gait. ($m=5$kg,
      $m_h=10$kg, $a=b=0.5$m, $\phi=0.0525$rad. $\bx(0)=[0,0,0.4,-2.0]^T$).
      Drawn is the phase portait of the left leg angle, which is recovered from
      $\theta_{st}$ and $\theta_{sw}$ in the simulation with some simple
      book-keeping.</figcaption> </figure>

      <p>The basin of attraction of the stable limit cycle is a narrow band of
      states surrounding the steady state trajectory.  Although the simplicity
      of this model makes it analytically attractive, this lack of stability
      makes it difficult to implement on a physical device.</p>

    <subsection><h1>The Kneed Walker</h1>

      <p>To achieve a more anthropomorphic gait, as well as to acquire better
      foot clearance and ability to walk on rough terrain, we want to model a
      walker that includes knee<elib>Hsu07</elib>. For this, we model each leg
      as two links with a point mass each.</p>

      <figure>
      <img width="60%" src="figures/kneedwalker.svg"/>
      <figcaption>The Kneed Walker</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>At the beginning of each step, the system is modeled as a three-link
      pendulum, like the ballistic
      walker<elib>McMahon80+Mochon80+Spong03</elib>. The stance leg is the one
      in front, and it is the first link of a pendulum, with two point masses.
      The swing leg has two links, with the joint between them unconstrained
      until knee-strike. Given appropriate mass distributions and initial
      conditions, the swing leg bends the knee and swings forward. When the
      swing leg straightens out (the lower and upper length are aligned),
      knee-strike occurs. The knee-strike is modeled as a discrete inelastic
      collision, conserving angular momentum and changing velocities
      instantaneously.</p>

      <p>After this collision, the knee is locked and we switch to the compass
      gait model with a different mass distribution. In other words, the system
      becomes a two-link pendulum. Again, the heel-strike is modeled as an
      inelastic collision. After the collision, the legs switch instantaneously.
      After heel-strike then, we switch back to the ballistic walker's
      three-link pendulum dynamics. This describes a full step cycle of the
      kneed walker, which is shown above.</p>

      <figure>
      <img width="100%" src="figures/kwcycle1.svg"/>
      <figcaption>Limit cycle trajectory for kneed walker</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>By switching between the dynamics of the continuous three-link and
      two-link pendulums with the two discrete collision events, we characterize
      a full point-feed kneed walker walking cycle. After finding appropriate
      parameters for masses and link lengths, a stable gait is found. As with
      the compass gait's limit cycle, there is a swing phase (top) and a stance
      phase (bottom). In addition to the two heel-strikes, there are two more
      instantaneous velocity changes from the knee-strikes as marked in the
      figure. This limit cycle is traversed clockwise.</p>

    <subsection><h1>The Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum</h1>

      <p>The model is a point mass, $m$, on top of a massless, springy leg with
      rest length of $l_0$, and spring constant $k$.  The state of the system
      is given by the $x,y$ position of the center of mass, and the length,
      $l$, and angle $\theta$ of the leg.  Like the rimless wheel, the dynamics
      are modeled piecewise - with one dynamics governing the flight phase, and
      another governing the stance phase.</p>

      <p>Flight Phase.  State variables: $\bx = [x,y,\dot{x},\dot{y}]^T.$
      Dynamics are $$\dot{\bx} = \begin{bmatrix} \dot{x} \\ \dot{y} \\ 0 \\ - g
      \end{bmatrix}.$$</p>

      <p>Stance Phase. State variables: $\bx = [r, \theta, \dot{r},
      \dot\theta]^T.$ Kinematics are $$x = \begin{bmatrix} - r \sin\theta \\ r
      \cos\theta \end{bmatrix},$$ Energy is given by $$T = \frac{m}{2}
      (\dot{r}^2 + r^2 \dot\theta^2 ), \quad U = mgr\cos\theta +
      \frac{k}{2}(r_0 - r)^2.$$ Plugging these into Lagrange yields:
      \begin{gather} m \ddot{r} - m r \dot\theta^2 + m g \cos\theta - k (r_0 -
      r) = 0 \\ m r^2 \ddot{\theta} + 2mr\dot{r}\dot\theta - mgr \sin\theta = 0
      \end{gather}</p>
